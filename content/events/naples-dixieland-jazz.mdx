## Traditional Jazz Under the Florida Sun

The Naples Dixieland Jazz Band has been swinging for decades, bringing the joyful sounds of traditional New Orleans-style jazz to Cambier Park. These free Sunday afternoon concerts are a Naples institution.

## The Music

### What You'll Hear

- Audience-favorite singalongs

### The Band
A rotating ensemble of talented local musicians keeps the tradition alive, featuring trumpet, trombone, clarinet, piano, bass, and drums.

## The Experience

Bring a blanket or lawn chairs to the Cambier Park Bandshell. The band plays under the covered shell while audiences spread across the lawn. Dancing is encouraged!
