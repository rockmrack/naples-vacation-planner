## America's Most Philanthropic Wine Event

The Naples Wine Festival has raised over $200 million for children's charities, making it one of the nation's most successful charity wine auctions. This three-day celebration brings together prestigious vintners, celebrity chefs, and generous philanthropists.

## The Experience

### Vintner Dinners
Friday evening features intimate dinners hosted by Naples' most gracious residents, paired with exceptional wines from participating vintners.

### The Auction
Saturday's live auction at The Ritz-Carlton features unique lots—vineyard visits, private dinners, rare wine collections—with bidding that often reaches seven figures.

### Meet the Masters
Interact with winemakers from Napa, Bordeaux, and beyond. Celebrity chefs create culinary masterpieces to pair with world-class wines.

## Tickets

This is an exclusive, invitation-based event with tickets starting at $10,000+ per couple. Proceeds benefit the Naples Children & Education Foundation.

## Why It Matters

Beyond the wine and food, the Festival supports underprivileged and at-risk children in Collier County through grants to local nonprofits.
