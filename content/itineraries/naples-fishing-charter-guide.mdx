## Option 1: Backwater / Inshore (The Classic)
*Calm water, light tackle, technical casting.*

*   **Target Species:** Snook, Redfish, Tarpon (Spring/Summer), Sea Trout.
*   **The Experience:** You’ll be on a flats boat (skiff) navigating shallow mangroves. It’s visual fishing—often sight-casting.
*   **Best Location:** Ten Thousand Islands (south of Naples).
*   **Sea Sickness:** None. It’s flat calm.

## Option 2: Nearshore / Offshore
*Deep water, big fights, dinner.*

*   **Target Species:** Grouper, Snapper, Kingfish, sometimes Shark.
*   **The Experience:** You’ll be 10-30 miles out. It’s about bottom fishing (dropping bait down) and reeling up heavy fish.
*   **Bonus:** You can often keep your catch, and local restaurants (like **The Dock**) will cook it for you ("Hook and Cook").

<EditorNote>
  **License:** If you go on a hired charter (with a Captain), their license covers you. You do NOT need to buy one. If you fish from the pier or beach, you need a FL saltwater license.
</EditorNote>

### Recommended Captains
*   **Captain Marvel Charters:** Great for families/kids.
*   **Hope Fishing Adventures:** Serious light tackle expertise.
