# Party of One: Solo in Paradise

Naples is one of the safest cities in the US, making it ideal for solo travelers. It’s not a "clubbing" city, but a place to disconnect, read, and dine well.

## Day 1: Reconnect with Yourself
*A quiet start.*

### Morning: Beach Read
Head to **Vanderbilt Beach**. Rent a chair. Read that book you’ve been ignoring.

### Lunch: The Ritz-Carlton Beach Bar
Gumbo Limbo again. Sit at the bar. It’s the easiest place to chat with bartenders and other travelers.

---

## Day 2: Group Activities
*Be social without the pressure.*

### Morning: Manatee Eco-Tour
Join a group boat tour (like **Double R's Manatee Tour**). You share the boat with 15 others, making it easy to bond over seeing a manatee.

### Evening: HobNob Kitchen
Eat at **HobNob** on 5th. Their bar scene is vibrant but sophisticated. Great craft cocktails and small plates perfect for one.

---

## Day 3: Culture
*Feed your mind.*

### Morning: Baker Museum
Art galleries are perfect for solo contemplation.

### Afternoon: Mercato Blue Martini
If you *do* want to dance or meet people, **Blue Martini** at Mercato is the spot. Early evening is happy hour; late night is a party.
