## The goal of this weekend

This plan is designed to feel **easy**:

- One classic Old Naples day (walkability, dining, sunset)
- One flexible beach-first morning plus a simple nature or garden option

If you want the most walkable base, start here:

## Day 1 — Old Naples + sunset night

### Morning: Arrive + Old Naples stroll

Keep your first morning light: coffee, a walk, and getting oriented around 5th Avenue South and 3rd Street South.

### Afternoon: Beach time

Pick one beach and commit. Don’t try to “collect” beaches.

### Evening: Sunset + dinner

Make sunset the anchor of your first night. In peak season, arrive earlier for parking and a stress-free spot.

---

## Day 2 — Slow morning + choose your “one experience”

### Morning: Early beach walk

Naples is at its best in the morning—cooler, quieter, and calmer.

### Midday: Choose one

- A garden-style reset (great in warm months)
- A short wildlife/mangrove tour (book ahead in peak season)

### Afternoon: Wrap-up and depart

Keep it simple: lunch, one last walk, then head out.
