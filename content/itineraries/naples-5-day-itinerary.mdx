<EditorNote type="info">
  **Family Travel Tip:** Naples is incredibly kid-friendly, but dinner reservations at popular spots often book up 2-3 weeks in advance during school holidays (Christmas, Spring Break).

## Why Naples Works for Families
Forget the chaos of Orlando. Naples offers a different kind of magic: spotting wild dolphins, finding sand dollars, and walking through butterfly gardens. It’s safe, clean, and surprisingly adventurous.

## Day 1: The Perfect Beach Day
*Theme: Sandcastles and gentle waves.*

### Morning: Clam Pass Park (9:00 AM)
Skip the main pier for your first day. **Clam Pass Park** is an adventure in itself.
*   **The Tram:** Kids love the free golf cart tram ride through the mangrove forest to the beach.
*   **The Beach:** It’s located near a pass, so there's a gentle current that's fun to float in (with life jackets).
*   **Lunch:** Grab burgers at the beachfront **Rhode's End** resort bar right on the sand (part of Naples Grande, but open to public).

### Afternoon: Check-In & Chill
Head to your hotel for the all-important mid-day pool break.

### Evening: Mercato Lawn (6:00 PM)
**Mercato** in North Naples is perfect for families.
*   **Dinner:** **The Hampton Social** (great seafood) or **Rocco's Tacos**.
*   **Play:** There is a large grassy lawn where kids run around while parents finish their drinks.

## Day 2: Lions, Tigers, and... Giraffes
*Theme: Animal encounters.*

### Morning: Naples Zoo (9:00 AM)
This is a historic botanical garden that happens to be a zoo.
*   **Must-Do:** Take the **Primate Expedition Cruise** (catamaran boat ride through monkey islands). It's included in admission.
*   **Feed the Giraffes:** For $5, kids can hand-feed lettuce to the giraffes. It’s the ultimate photo op.

<ExpertTip author="Sarah">
  **Zoo Hack:** Bring swimsuits! The zoo isn't huge, so you'll be done by 1 PM. Head straight to **Lowdermilk Park** afterwards—it's only 5 mins away and has a great playground on the beach.

## Day 3: Into the Wild (Everglades)
*Theme: Real Florida adventure.*

### Morning: Airboat Tour (10:00 AM)
Drive 35 mins east on Tamiami Trail. You are entering the Everglades.
*   **Operator:** **Wooten's** or **Captain Jack’s**.
*   **The Experience:** 30-45 minutes skimming across the water. You *will* see alligators. Ear protection is provided (and necessary!).

### Lunch: Gator Bites?
Stop at **Joanie's Blue Crab Cafe**. It’s an old-school roadside shack. Yes, they serve gator nuggets. It’s a rite of passage!

### Afternoon: Coral Cay Adventure Golf
Back in Naples, unwind with 18 holes of mini-golf at **Coral Cay**. It’s lush, tropical, and well-maintained.

---

## Day 4: Science & Sunsets
*Theme: Learning and views.*

### Morning: Golisano Children's Museum (C'mon)
Ideally saved for a rainy day, but worth a visit anytime.
*   **Highlights:** The "banyan tree" climbing structure and the Everglades exhibit.
*   **Age Range:** Best for kids under 10.

### Evening: The Naples Pier (Sunset)
Park at 12th Ave S and walk the beach.
*   **Activity:** Look for dolphins swimming just offshore.
*   **Dinner:** Walk to **Tommy Bahama** on 3rd Street South. It’s loud, fun, and the food is consistently good.

## Day 5: Island Hopping
*Theme: Shelling and boats.*

### All Day: Marco Island Trip
Drive 30 mins south to Marco Island.
*   **Morning:** **Tigertail Beach**. Wading across the lagoon is an adventure, and the shelling on the sandspit is world-class.
*   **Lunch:** **The Snook Inn**. It’s famous for a reason—right on the water, live music, and a pickle bar kids obsess over.

## FAQ for Parents

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "Do I need a car seat?",
    answer: "Yes, Florida law requires car seats for children age 5 and under. Rental agencies offer them, but bringing your own is cleaner and safer."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there jellyfish?",
    answer: "Sometimes in summer. Most beaches have a flag system (Purple Flag = Marine Pests). Check the lifeguard stand when you arrive."
  }
