# Before the Ritz: The Historic Naples

Naples wasn't always mansions and Maseratis. It started as a mosquito-infested swamp that only the toughest pioneers could tame. This 1-day itinerary takes you back in time.

## Morning: Old Naples Historic District

### Palm Cottage
Start at the **Naples Historical Society’s Historic Palm Cottage** (12th Ave S). Built in 1895, it is the oldest house in Naples.
*   **Do:** Take the guided tour. It’s fascinating to see how they lived without A/C (hint: taboddy concrete walls).

### Walking Tour
The Historical Society offers a walking tour of the surrounding district. You’ll see the original cottages that have survived hurricanes and development.

---

## Lunch: Campiello
Why here? Because it’s located in the historic **Naples Mercantile Building**. You are eating in a piece of history.

---

## Afternoon: Trains & Planes

### Naples Depot Museum
Located on 5th Ave S. This restored Seaboard Air Line Railway station shows how the railroad finally connected Naples to the world in the 1920s.
*   **See:** The vintage train cars outside and the dugout canoes inside.

### Holocaust Museum & Cohen Education Center
A somber but incredibly important stop. It houses over 1,000 artifacts and often has survivors or their descendants volunteering.

<ExpertTip>
  **Read Before You Go:** Read "Shadow Country" by Peter Matthiessen. It’s a (fictionalized) award-winning history of the chaotic Everglades frontier days.
