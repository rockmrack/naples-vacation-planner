<EditorNote type="info">
  **Logistics:** Naples and Marco Island are only **25 minutes apart**. You do *not* need to change hotels. We recommend staying in Naples (more dining/nightlife) and treating Marco as a day trip destination.

## A Tale of Two Paradises
*   **Naples** is the sophisticated older sister: art galleries, fine dining, manicured streets.
*   **Marco Island** is the wilder cousin: massive wide beaches, 10,000 islands access, and a laid-back boat culture.
*   **Together:** They make the perfect vacation.

## Day 1: Welcome to Naples (The City)
*Theme: Getting acclimated in style.*

### Afternoon: Check-in & The Pier
Start at the heart of it all.
*   **Walk:** Park near 12th Ave S and walk the **Naples Pier**.
*   **Swim:** The water here is calm and clear. Vibrant blue in the winter months.
*   **Dinner:** Walk up 3rd Street South to **Barbatella** (Italian) or **Sea Salt**.

---

## Day 2: Marco Island Safari
*Theme: Island vibes and wildlife.*

### Morning: Tigertail Beach
Drive south to Marco. Head straight to **Tigertail Beach Park**.
*   **The Adventure:** You have to wade across a shallow lagoon to get to the "real" beach. It’s an adventure kids and adults love.
*   **The Reward:** On the other side is a pristine, white-sand spit filled with sand dollars and conch shells.

### Lunch: The Snook Inn
This is a Marco Island institution.
*   **The Vibe:** Thatched roof, waterside, live band playing Jimmy Buffett.
*   **Order:** The Grouper Sandwich and hit the massive pickle bar.

### Afternoon: The 10,000 Islands
Marco is the gateway to the Everglades' **Ten Thousand Islands**.
*   **Activity:** Book the **Dolphin Explorer** or **Marco Island Water Sports** tour.
*   **Why:** You are almost guaranteed to see dolphins jumping in the boat's wake. It’s magical.

---

## Day 3: Naples Culture & Dining
*Theme: Art and Taste.*

### Morning: Tin City
Back in Naples, visit **Tin City**. It’s a rustic waterfront shops area.
*   **Shop:** Cute local souvenirs (coral, soaps, t-shirts).
*   **History:** It used to be the center of the clam shelling and oyster industry.

### Afternoon: The Zoo or Garden
*   **Choice:** If you love animals, **Naples Zoo**. If you love flowers, **Naples Botanical Garden**. Both are world-class.

### Evening: 5th Avenue South
Dress up a little (resort casual).
*   **Dinner:** **Ocean Prime** or **Truluck's**.
*   **After:** Grab gelato at **Adelheidi's** (organic and gluten-free options!) and listen to the street performers.

---

## Day 4: One Last Splash
*Theme: Relaxation before departure.*

### Morning: Lowdermilk Park
One last beach session at **Lowdermilk Park**.
*   **Amenities:** Great snack bar for breakfast sandwiches.
*   **Activity:** Rent a paddleboard if the water is flat gently paddle north to see the mansions from the water.

### Lunch: Waterfront Farewell
Head to **The Bay House** in North Naples (on your way to the airport) for a "Old Florida" style seafood lunch overlooking the river.

## Where to Stay: Naples or Marco?

<ExpertTip author="Jennifer">
  **My Verdict:** Stay in **Naples**. You have 100+ restaurants within walking distance. Use your car to visit Marco Island for the day. Staying on Marco is great, but can feel a bit isolated at night.
</ExpertTip>

*   **Naples Pick:** **Bellasera Resort**. Central, easy parking, close to the bridge to Marco.
*   **Marco Pick:** **JW Marriott Marco Island**. If you *do* stay on Marco, this huge resort is the place to be. Fantastic beach, arcade for kids, and luxury pools.
