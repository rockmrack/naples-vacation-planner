## Day 1: The Masterpieces
*World-class institutions.*

### Morning: The Baker Museum (Artis-Naples)
Start at **The Baker Museum**. It’s the crown jewel of Southwest Florida art.
*   **Must See:** The Chihuly gates (permanent) and the rotating modern exhibitions. The architecture of the building itself is art.

### Lunch: Lamoraga
Nearby in the Naples Design District. Modern Spanish tapas in a sleek setting.

### Afternoon: Naples Design District
Wander the "Design District" (around 10th St S).
*   **Visit:** **Method & Concept** (contemporary design), and the various interior design showrooms. It’s where the locals source their grand home decor.

## Day 2: The Gallery Row
*Intimate galleries and antiques.*

### Morning: 3rd Street South
The area around 3rd Street South and Broad Avenue is "Gallery Row."
*   **The Vibe:** High-end, curated, and walkable.
*   **Visit:** **Gardner Colby Gallery** and **Harmon-Meek Gallery** (the oldest in Naples, est. 1964).

### Lunch: Ridgway Bar & Grill
Sit in the garden. It feels very European.

### Afternoon: The von Liebig Art Center
Located behind 5th Avenue. They often feature local member shows and offer quick workshops if you want to get your hands dirty.

<ExpertTip>
  **Art After Dark:** Check the schedule for "Evening on Fifth" or gallery walks, where galleries stay open late with wine and music.
