## The World's Best-Kept Automotive Secret

Hidden in an industrial park in Naples sits one of the **most extraordinary car collections in the world**: **The Revs Institute**. Home to over 100 historically significant automobiles—many of which are one-of-a-kind—this is not your typical car museum. It's a **research institution** dedicated to the preservation of automotive history.

## What Makes The Revs Institute Special?

### It's Not a Showroom—It's a Working Collection

Unlike most car museums:
- Every car is **running and road-worthy**
- Cars are regularly exercised (not just displayed)
- No ropes—you can get close to the vehicles
- Expert docents (many are former engineers or racers)
- Research library with automotive archives

### The Collection

| Category | Highlights |
|----------|------------|
| **Porsche** | 917, 904, 550 Spyder, 356 |
| **Alfa Romeo** | 8C 2900, Tipo B, 6C 1750 |

<ExpertTip>
**Pro Tip:** This is not a walk-in museum. You MUST book a tour in advance. Tours are small and personal (12–15 people max), led by incredibly knowledgeable guides.
