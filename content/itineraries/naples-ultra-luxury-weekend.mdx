## Day 1: Arrival in Style
*Private aviation and private beaches.*

### Arrival: Naples Airport (APF)
If you are flying private, you’ll land right in town at **Naples Airport (APF)**. Your pre-arranged car service (we recommend **Naples Transportation & Tours**) will whisk you to your suite in under 15 minutes.

### Stay: The Ritz-Carlton Club Level
Check into the **Club Level** at the **Ritz-Carlton, Naples** (Beach Resort). The concierge here is legendary. The Club Lounge offers five culinary presentations daily and unlimited champagne.

### Evening: Chef’s Table at Sails
Dinner at **Sails Restaurant** on 5th Avenue. This is the closest you’ll get to Monaco in Florida.
<ExpertTip>
  Book the "Chef's Table" experience well in advance. You'll have a front-row seat to the kitchen and a customized multi-course tasting menu paired with rare vintages from their cellar.

## Day 2: The Yacht Life & Haute Couture
*The quintessential Naples experience.*

### Morning: Private Yacht Charter
Don't just look at the water; own it. Charter a 60ft+ Sunseeker from **Naples Nantucket Charters** for the day. Cruise to Keewaydin, dock for a catered lunch, or head north to Sanibel. It’s total privacy and total luxury.

### Afternoon: VIP Shopping on 5th Ave
Back on land, head to **Marissa Collections** on 3rd Street South (the "Rodeo Drive" of Naples). Their personal shoppers can curate a room of Oscar de la Renta and Brunello Cucinelli for you.
Don't miss **Sak's Fifth Avenue** at Waterside for other luxury staples.

### Evening: Steak & Stone Crabs
Dinner at **Truluck's**. It’s old-school glamour. Order the fresh Florida Stone Crabs (in season) and the Prime Bone-in Ribeye. The service is impeccable.

## Day 3: Golf & Gold
*World-class greens and golden hour.*

### Morning: Tiburón Golf Club
Play where the pros play. **Tiburón** (at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort) hosts the LPGA and the QBE Shootout. The Black Course is challenging and manicured to perfection.
*Not a golfer?* Rent a private cabana at the Ritz pool instead.

### Afternoon: Afternoon Tea
Enjoy a traditional Afternoon Tea at **The Brambles English Tea Room**. It’s a charming, quiet pause in a hidden courtyard.

### Departure
Your car service returns you to APF, relaxed and refreshed.
