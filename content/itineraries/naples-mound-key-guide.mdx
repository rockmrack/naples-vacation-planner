## An Island Made of Shells

**Mound Key** is unlike anywhere else in Florida—a 125-acre island **created entirely by Native Americans** from discarded shells over 2,000 years. It was once the capital of the powerful Calusa people who ruled Southwest Florida.

The catch? It's **only accessible by water**.

## The Fascinating History

### The Calusa People

Long before Europeans arrived, the Calusa controlled much of South Florida:
- Population of ~20,000
- Fierce warriors (they killed Ponce de León!)
- Shell-working artisans
- Created artificial islands like Mound Key

### Mound Key as Capital

|--------|--------|
| **500–1750 AD** | Calusa capital |
