## Naples' Best-Kept Beach Secret

While tourists flock to Naples Pier Beach, locals know to head to **Clam Pass Park**—a secluded beach accessed via a scenic tram ride through a mangrove forest. It's one of Naples' most beautiful and peaceful beach experiences.

---

## What Makes Clam Pass Special

### The Experience

1. **Park at the Registry Resort lot** ($10/day for non-guests)
2. **Board the free tram** through a canopy of mangroves
3. **Walk a short boardwalk** through the forest
4. **Emerge onto a pristine, less-crowded beach**

The journey itself is half the experience—you'll feel like you're traveling to a remote island.

### Why It's Different

| Feature | Clam Pass | Typical Naples Beach |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Crowd level** | Low | Moderate to High |
| **Access** | Tram + boardwalk | Direct |
| **Natural setting** | Mangrove forest | Developed |
| **Vibe** | Secluded, peaceful | Social |
| **Wildlife** | Birds, fish, crabs | Limited |
