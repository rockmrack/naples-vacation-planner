## The Art of the Naples "Slowcation"
Seven days allows you to drop the "checklist" mentality (and the stress). This itinerary is designed to sync your rhythm with the tides. Late breakfasts, long beach walks, and zero rushing.

## Days 1-3: Settling into Paradise
*Focus: Old Naples, The Beach, and Gardens.*

### Day 1: Arrival & The Avenue
Ease into it.
*   **Afternoon:** Check into your hotel and walk **5th Avenue South**.
*   **Dinner:** **HobNob Kitchen**. Stylish, modern, and incredible food.
*   **Sunset:** Walk off dinner at the beach (5th Ave ends at the sand).

### Day 2: The Iconic Beach Day
*   **Morning:** Head to **Lowdermilk Park** or just south of the Pier. Rent a chair and umbrella. Do nothing for 4 hours.
*   **Lunch:** **First Watch** (Banyan Blvd) for a healthy brunch.
*   **Evening:** **3rd Street South**. It’s the "Paris" of Naples. Dinner at **Sea Salt** (try the seafood platter).

### Day 3: Botanical Zen
*   **Morning:** **Naples Botanical Garden**. The orchid house is spectacular.
*   **Lunch:** The garden’s own **Fogg Café** uses ingredients grown on-site.
*   **Afternoon:** Nap. Seriously. You’re on vacation.

<ExpertTip author="Jennifer">
  **Secret Spot:** In the Botanical Garden, find the "Birding Tower" in the Florida Garden. It offers a stunning view over the nature preserve that most tourists miss.

## Days 4-5: Adventure & Exploration
*Focus: The Water and the Wild.*

### Day 4: Keewaydin Island (The Local's Choice)
You can't drive here. You have to boat.
*   **The Plan:** Rent a pontoon boat from **Naples Bay Resort** or take the **Hemingway Water Shuttle**.
*   **The Experience:** Keewaydin is a barrier island with no buildings. Just miles of shells and food boats (floating food trucks!) that pull up on the sand.
*   **Lunch:** Burgers and tacos from the food boats.

### Day 5: The Everglades or Golf
Choose your own adventure:
*   **Option A (Nature):** **Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary**. A boardwalk through an ancient cypress forest. Quiet, spiritual, prehistoric.
*   **Option B (Sport):** Play a round at **Tiburon** (home of the shark shootout).

## Days 6-7: The Grand Finale
*Focus: Luxury and Farewells.*

### Day 6: Spa & Sunset
*   **Morning:** Spa treatment at **The Ritz-Carlton Naples** (Tiburon or Beach resort). Their mineral pools are world-class.
