## Florida's Most Unusual State Park

Just 20 minutes north of Naples, **Koreshan State Park** preserves the remains of a 19th-century utopian religious community—complete with original buildings, tropical gardens, and a fascinating story of eccentric beliefs and communal living.

---

## The Strange History

### The Koreshan Unity Settlement

In 1894, **Cyrus Teed** (who called himself "Koresh") led his followers from Chicago to Florida to establish a utopian community.

**Their Beliefs (Yes, Really):**
- The Earth is **hollow** and we live on the inside
- Celibacy (which is why the community eventually died out)
- Communal living and gender equality (progressive for the 1890s)
- The leader would be resurrected (he wasn't)

The last member, Hedwig Michel, deeded the settlement to the state in 1961.
