# Reclaim Your Glow: The Naples Wellness Edit

Naples isn't just about indulgence; it's a Blue Zone-adjacent haven of health and longevity. With fresh ocean air, abundant sunshine, and world-class spas, it's the perfect place for a 3-day reset.

This itinerary skips the heavy fried foods and packed schedules in favor of mindfulness, movement, and deep relaxation.

## Day 1: Grounding & Arrival
*Arrive and connect with the elements.*

### Morning: Beach Yoga at Lowdermilk Park
Start your trip by grounding yourself. **Donation Yoga Naples** offers classes right on the sand at Lowdermilk Park every morning. There is nothing like savasana with the sound of real waves.

### Lunch: Organic Fuel at True Food Kitchen
Head to Waterside Shops for lunch at **True Food Kitchen**. Their anti-inflammatory menu is delicious and leaves you energized.
*   **Order:** The Ancient Grains Bowl with grilled shrimp and an Edamame Dumpling starter.

### Afternoon: The Salt Cave
Visit **Salt Cave of Naples**. Relax in a zero-gravity chair inside a room made of 20,000 pounds of Himalayan pink salt. Halotherapy is fantastic for your respiratory system and deeply calming.

---

## Day 2: The Ultimate Spa Day
*Dedicate a full day to professional pampering.*

### The Main Event: The Spa at Seagate
We recommend spending your day at **The Spa at The Seagate Hotel** or **The Ritz-Carlton**.
For a unique local experience, try the **Om Spa** in Old Naples for a more holistic, boutique vibe.

**Recommended Treatment:**
*   **Sea-Holistic Treatment:** A warm seashell massage that combines heat and pressure to melt tension.

<EditorNote>
  Hydrate! Naples heat can be deceiving. Drink twice as much water as you think you need, especially after a massage.
</EditorNote>

### Evening: Plant-Based Fine Dining
Dinner at **The Local**. Chef Jeff Mitchell pioneered the farm-to-table movement in Naples. They cater brilliantly to vegan, gluten-free, and keto diets without sacrificing flavor.

---

## Day 3: Active Recovery
*Nature heals.*

### Morning: Kayak the Mangroves
Rent a kayak at **Clam Pass Park**. The physical activity is low-impact, and gliding through the silent mangrove tunnels is a moving meditation. Keep an eye out for herons and osprey.

### Lunch: Sail Place
Enjoy a light acai bowl or fresh smoothie at **Delicious Raw** on 5th Avenue.

### Afternoon: Walking Meditation at Naples Botanical Garden
Spend your final hours at the **Naples Botanical Garden**. Walk the labyrinth in the Asian Garden. It’s designed for contemplation. Sit by the water in the Brazilian Garden and just *be*.
