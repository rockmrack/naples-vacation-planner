# Into the Tunnels: Kayaking Naples

The real magic of Naples isn't the open ocean; it's the "Old Florida" feel of the mangrove estuary. It’s quiet, shaded, and teeming with life.

## Top 3 Kayak Trails

### 1. The Clam Pass Tunnel (Beginner Friendly)
*   **Launch:** Clam Pass Park.
*   **The Vibe:** A narrow, magical tunnel of red mangroves that opens up into a lagoon. Very calm water, impossible to get lost.
*   **Rental:** On-site concessions available.

### 2. Isle of Capri (Paddle Park)
*   **Launch:** Isles of Capri Paddlecraft Park.
*   **The Vibe:** More open water, great for seeing manatees (in winter) and massive flocks of pelicans.
*   **Note:** Watch the tidal current here; it can be strong.

### 3. Rookery Bay (The Wilderness)
*   **Launch:** Shell Island Road.
*   **The Vibe:** Pure wilderness. You are in the National Estuarine Research Reserve. Tens of thousands of acres of pristine water.
*   **Guide Recommended:** It’s a maze. We recommend a tour with **Rising Tide Explorers** (the only biologists-guided tour).

<ExpertTip>
  **Tide Matters:** Paddling against a strong outgoing tide is a workout. Check a tide chart app like "Tide Alert" before you go.
