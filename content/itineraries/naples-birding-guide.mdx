## The "Big Four" Locations

### 1. Eagle Lakes Community Park
Don't let the "community park" name fool you. It’s arguably the best spot in soaring season.
*   **Look For:** Snail Kites (endangered), Limpkins, and yes, Bald Eagles nesting right above the soccer fields.

### 2. Tigertail Beach (Marco Island)
A globally important shorebird area.
*   **Look For:** Red Knots, Piping Plovers, Black Skimmers, and the "Great Florida Birding Trail" signage.

### 3. Cape Romano (By Boat)
Accessible only by water.
*   **Look For:** Magnificent Frigatebirds soaring high (they look like pterodactyls) and massive flocks of White Pelicans in winter.

### 4. Brian Piccolo Park (Ft. Lauderdale day trip)
*Strictly* for the **Burrowing Owls**. These tiny owls live in holes in the ground (on the baseball fields, believe it or not). It’s worth the drive across Alligator Alley.

<ExpertTip>
  **Seasonality:** Winter (Jan-March) is peak season for migratory birds. Summer is quiet but good for local wading birds nurturing chicks.
