# Paws in the Sand: Visiting with Pets

Naples is surprisingly dog-friendly, provided you know where to go. While the main city beaches have restrictions, there are paradises waiting for your pup.

## Day 1: The Beach Day

### Morning: Bonita Beach Dog Beach
This is the holy grail. It’s an off-leash dog beach located just north of Naples (on the way to Ft. Myers Beach). The water is shallow, and dogs run wild.
*   **Bring:** Fresh water (no taps there) and poop bags.

### Lunch: Coconut Jack’s Waterfront Grille
Just down the street. Very dog-friendly patio right on the water. They’ll bring a water bowl for Fido.

## Day 2: City Stroll

### Morning: Naples Botanical Garden (Sundays & Tuesdays)
*Check Schedule!* The Garden has specific "dog walking hours" on certain mornings. Walking the tropical pathways with your dog is a delight.

### Afternoon: 3rd Street South
Many boutiques here put water bowls out.
*   **Shop:** **The Dog & Cat** pet boutique. Gourmet treats and luxury collars.

### Dinner: The Dock at Crayton Cove
The patio is super casual and welcomes dogs. Watch the boats go by.

<ExpertTip>
  **Hotel Policy:** The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort is very pet-friendly (with fee). For no fees, look at **La Quinta**.
