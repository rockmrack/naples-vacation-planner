# Validating the Vibe: Naples for Teens

Teenagers can be the toughest critics. Naples might seem "quiet," but if you know where to look, it’s full of high-speed adventure and aesthetic spots for their feed.

## Day 1: Speed & Sea
*Start with high adrenaline.*

### Morning: Jet Ski Tour
Don't just sit on the beach; explore it. Book a guided WaveRunner tour through the Ten Thousand Islands.
*   **The draw:** Speed, jumping waves, and seeing dolphins up close. It’s impossible to be bored on a jet ski.

### Lunch: Brooks Gourmet Burgers
Head to **Brooks Gourmet Burgers & Dogs**. It’s casual, eclectic, and serves massive, creative burgers and milkshakes that are very photo-worthy.

### Afternoon: Vintage Shopping
Teens love thrifting. Take them to the **Tamiami Trail design district** or some of the high-end consignment shops like **True Fashionistas**. Finding a "vintage" Gucci bag or cool streetwear is a major win.

---

## Day 2: The Instagram Tour
*Do it for the 'Gram.*

### Morning: Breakfast at The Bowl
Start at **The Bowl** (Central Ave or Pine Ridge). They serve aesthetic acai bowls that are a staple for the VSCO girl / TikTok crowd.

### Afternoon: 5th Avenue & Cambier Park
Walk 5th Avenue.
*   **Stop:** **Kilwins** for ice cream.
*   **Photo Op:** The "Naples" mural near the attractions or the banyan trees in Cambier Park.
*   **Shopping:** Let them roam into **Wind in the Willows** or the surf shops.

### Evening: Sunset at the Pier
Yes, it's cliché, but it's the social hub. Teens gather near the pier at sunset to hang out, play spikeball, and take photos.

---

## Day 3: Wild Florida
*Something they can't do at home.*

### Morning: Airboat Everglade Tour
Drive 45 minutes south to Everglades City.
*   **Activity:** An airboat ride. It’s loud, fast, and you see alligators. It feels like real adventure.
*   **Provider:** **Captain Jack's** or **Jungle Erv’s**.

### Lunch: Tacos & Tequila
(Or similar lively spot). **Tacos & Tequila Cantina** is fun, loud, and serves great Tex-Mex.

### Afternoon: Mercato
End the trip at **Mercato** in North Naples. It’s a more modern outdoor mall with a cinema (**Silverspot**) and plenty of trendier shops like **Nordstrom Rack** and **Tommy Bahama**.
