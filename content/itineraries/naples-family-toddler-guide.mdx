# Little Steps in Paradise: Naples with Toddlers

Naples is surprisingly toddler-friendly. The Gulf waters are typically calm (no big waves to knock little ones over), the sand is soft, and the pace is slow. This itinerary minimizes driving and maximizes nap-time potential.

## Day 1: The Perfect Beach Day
*Sun, sand, and shade.*

### Morning: Lowdermilk Park
Skip the Pier for swimming; head to **Lowdermilk Park**.
*   **Why:** It has clean restrooms, a concession stand (coffee for you, snacks for them), and *outdoor showers* to rinse off the sand.
*   **Rent:** Bring or rent a large umbrella. The sun is strong.

### Lunch: Picnic in the Park
There are plenty of picnic tables at Lowdermilk under the banyan trees. Grab sandwiches from **Publix** (famous for their subs) on the way.

### Afternoon: The Nap & The Pool
Head back to your hotel for the all-important nap. Spend the late afternoon at the hotel pool.

## Day 2: Animals & Trains
*Wild encounters (safely).*

### Morning: Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens
Go early (opens at 9 AM) to beat the heat. The **Naples Zoo** is manageable in size—perfect for toddler legs.
*   **Must Do:** The Primate Expedition Cruise. It’s a gentle boat ride around islands of monkeys. Toddlers love it, and you get to sit down for 20 minutes.
*   **Feed:** You can feed the giraffes by hand! (Check schedule).

### Lunch: Pinchers
Lunch at **Pinchers** at Tin City. It’s loud, colorful, and kids eat free with adult entrees. Plus, they can look at the boats in the marina.

### Afternoon: The Golisano Children's Museum (C'MON)
If it’s too hot or raining, drive north to **C'MON**. It’s a world-class children's museum with a dedicated toddler area, water play station, and climbing structures.

## Day 3: Gardens & Splash Pads
*Running free in nature.*

### Morning: Naples Botanical Garden
The **Children's Garden** here is magical. There are butterfly houses, hidden tunnels to crawl through, and water fountains to splash in. Bring a change of clothes!

### Lunch: Food Truck Park at Celebration Park
Go to **Celebration Park**. It’s an outdoor bar with multiple food trucks.
*   **Why it works:** It’s loud, open-air, and right on the water. No need to worry about inside voices.

### Afternoon: Baker Park
End the trip at **Baker Park**. It has the best playground in the city, with soft flooring and distinct areas for small kids vs. big kids.
