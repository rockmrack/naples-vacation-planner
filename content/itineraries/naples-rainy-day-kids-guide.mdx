## Option 1: The Museum Day (Best for Ages 2-10)

### Morning: C'MON (Golisano Children's Museum)
This stays open when it rains. It’s huge (30,000 sq ft).
*   **Highlights:** The "Everglades" maze, the towering Banyan tree climber, and the art studio. You can easily kill 3-4 hours here.

### Lunch: Costco or Pollo Tropical
Nearby C'MON in North Naples. Quick, easy comfort food.

### Afternoon: Sun-N-Fun Lagoon (If just drizzling)
Sometimes, if it's just rain (no lightning), the water park **Sun-N-Fun Lagoon** is still fun. You're wet anyway! *Check lightning status first.*

---

## Option 2: The Entertainment Hub (Best for Teens/Older Kids)

### Location: Mercato or Coastland Center

### The Movies: Silverspot Cinema (Mercato) or Alamo Drafthouse (coming soon)
**Silverspot** offers luxury dine-in seating. Order lunch right to your leather recliner while watching a blockbuster.

### The Mall: Coastland Center
It’s a classic indoor mall.
*   **Activity:** Retail therapy.
*   **Food:** Cheesecake Factory (massive menu, kills lots of time).

---

## Option 3: Active Indoor (Burn that Energy)

### HeadPinz / Bowland
Located in East Naples or near Beacon.
*   **Activities:** Bowling, massive arcade, laser tag. It’s loud, chaotic, and kids love it.

### InPlay! Family Fun
An indoor playground facility with foam pits and slides. Great for the 3-8 age range to run safely inside.

<EditorNote>
  Florida storms often last only 60 minutes. Don't cancel your whole evening plan just because it's pouring at 3 PM!
