## Learn from Others' Mistakes

Even the most beautiful destination can disappoint if you don't know the local quirks. Here's what first-time Naples visitors often get wrong—and how to get it right.

## Top 10 First-Timer Mistakes

### 1. Not Making Dinner Reservations

**The Mistake:** Showing up at 7 PM expecting a table at Sea Salt or Barbatella.

**The Fix:** Book dinner reservations **2-3 weeks ahead** during season (Dec-Apr). Even off-season, weekend reservations are wise.

---

### 2. Arriving at the Beach at Noon

**The Mistake:** Prime beach time is NOT midday in Florida.

**The Fix:** 
- **Morning:** 7 AM – 11 AM (best time)
- **Afternoon:** 4 PM – sunset (second best)
- **Midday:** Reserved for pools and air conditioning

---

### 3. Underestimating Summer Storms

**The Mistake:** Planning all outdoor activities with no backup.

**The Fix:** Expect afternoon storms May-October. Plan outdoor activities for morning, indoor activities for 2-5 PM window.

---

### 4. Skipping the Naples Pier

**The Mistake:** "It's just a pier, right?"

**The Fix:** The pier is the heart of Naples. Go at sunset. Watch dolphins. See the pelicans dive. Take photos. It's free and unforgettable.

<ExpertTip>
**Pro Tip:** Arrive at Naples Pier 30-45 minutes before sunset. The approach, the crowd gathering, and the light changing are all part of the experience.
</ExpertTip>

### 5. Only Visiting Beaches

**The Mistake:** Naples = beaches only.

**The Fix:** Naples has world-class dining (5th Avenue), nature experiences (Corkscrew, Botanical Garden), and day trip options (Everglades, Sanibel). Diversify!

---

### 6. Ignoring the Heat

**The Mistake:** Walking 5th Avenue at 2 PM in August.

**The Fix:** Respect Florida heat. Hydrate constantly. Schedule air-conditioned breaks. Summer afternoons = indoor time.

---

### 7. Not Tipping Properly

**The Mistake:** European-style 10% tips.

**The Fix:** 18-20% is standard for good service. 15% is minimum. Servers rely on tips—it's not optional.

---

### 8. Renting a Car When You Don't Need One

**The Mistake:** Paying for parking everywhere.

**The Fix:** If staying downtown, you can walk 5th Ave, 3rd Street, pier, and beaches. Uber for day trips. Only rent if staying beachside or making multiple excursions.

---

### 9. Visiting Only in Peak Season

**The Mistake:** December-April crowds and prices.

**The Fix:** May-June and November are "shoulder seasons"—fewer crowds, lower prices, great weather. September is cheapest but hottest.

---

### 10. Not Bringing Cash

**The Mistake:** Assuming everywhere takes cards.

**The Fix:** Farmers markets, some beach vendors, and older establishments may be cash-only. Keep $50-100 on hand.
