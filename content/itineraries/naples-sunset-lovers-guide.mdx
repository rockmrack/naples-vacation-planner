# Chasing the Green Flash: A Sunset Hunter’s Guide

In Naples, sunset isn't just a time of day; it's a daily holiday. Locals pause, traffic slows, and everyone heads west. This itinerary is for those who want to maximize that magic hour every single evening.

## Day 1: The Classic Icon
*Start with the most famous view in Southwest Florida.*

### Afternoon: Early Dinner on 3rd
Eat early today (around 5:00 PM) at **Barbatella** or **Tommy Bahama**. You want to be done eating before the sky starts to turn color.

### Golden Hour: The Naples Pier
Walk to the **Naples Pier** (12th Ave S) about 45 minutes before sunset.
*Note: Due to hurricane repairs, you may need to view *from the beach* beside the pier rather than walking to the end.* 
This is arguably better for photos anyway, as you get the silhouette of the pier against the burning orange sky.

<ExpertTip>
  Look for the dolphins! They often feed near the pier at dusk.

## Day 2: Sunset Cocktail Style
*Sip a cold drink while the sun goes down.*

### The Spot: Gumbo Limbo
Head to the **Ritz-Carlton, Naples** and walk down to **Gumbo Limbo**. This is a casual, high-end tiki bar right on the boardwalk.
*   **Drink:** The "Sunset Punch" (rum, pineapple, orange).
*   **The Ritual:** When the sun hits the horizon, the staff rings a ceremonial bell. Everyone cheers. It’s a bucket-list Naples moment.

## Day 3: The Northern Front
*Escape the crowds at a hidden gem.*

### The Spot: Clam Pass Park
Park at **Clam Pass Park** (north Naples) and take the free tram ride through the mangroves to the beach.
This beach faces slightly more northwest, offering a different angle on the setting sun. It is often much quieter than the Pier.

### Dinner: The Turtle Club
If you can get a reservation (book 2 months out!), **The Turtle Club** is the holy grail. The tables are literally *in the sand*. If you can't get a table, bring a blanket and sit on the sand right next to the restaurant. The view is free.
