Naples style is a specific thing: "Coastal Chic." Think linen, bright whites, oversized sunglasses, and effortless elegance. Here is where to find it.

## Day 1: The Luxury Avenues

### Morning: 3rd Street South
Start here. It’s more boutique, less "chain store."
*   **Marissa Collections:** The department store that isn't a department store. It wins national awards.
*   **Gittleman’s:** For stunning jewelry.

### Lunch: The Continental
Right on 3rd. Great salads, see-and-be-seen vibe.

### Afternoon: 5th Avenue South
The "Main Street."
*   **White House Black Market:** Fun fact - the brand started neighboring Fort Myers!
*   **Port Royal Jewelers:** Window shop the diamonds.

## Day 2: Malls & Hidden Gems

### Morning: Waterside Shops
An open-air luxury mall. It’s beautiful just to walk around (fountains, waterfalls).
*   **Stores:** Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., Saks Fifth Avenue.

### Lunch: BrickTop's
At Waterside. The salads are huge.

### Afternoon: The Treasure Hunt
Naples has incredibly wealthy residents who donate incredibly high-end things.
*   **True Fashionistas:** A designer resale store. You can find pre-loved Louboutins and Chanel bags here for a fraction of retail.
*   **St. Matthew’s House Thrift:** You have to dig, but people have found Armani suits and Brooks Brothers blazers here.

<ExpertTip>
  **Tax Free:** Unlike diverse Europe, there is no VAT refund, but Florida sales tax (6%) is relatively low compared to other states.
