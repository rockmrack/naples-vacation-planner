# 90 Holes in 3 Days: The Golfer’s Dream

With more holes per capita than anywhere else on Earth, Naples is a pilgrimage site for golfers. The challenge isn't finding a course; it's getting a tee time.

## Day 1: The PGA Experience
*Play where the pros play.*

### Morning: Tiburón Golf Club (Gold Course)
Home to the LPGA Tour Championship and QBE Shootout. Designed by Greg Norman. The fairways are wide, but the bunkers are punishing.
*   **Booking:** Publicly bookable (but expensive). Stay at the Ritz Golf Resort for priority access.

### 19th Hole: Sydney’s Pub
Eat at the clubhouse. The burger is legendary.

---

## Day 2: The Public Gem
*Great golf without the membership.*

### Morning: Lely Resort (Flamingo Island)
Designed by Robert Trent Jones, Sr.
*   **Signature Hole:** The par-3 5th hole is an island surrounded by water. Bring extra balls.

### Evening: Celebration Park
Go casual tonight. You’ve been in a collared shirt all day.

---

## Day 3: The Links
*Old World style in Florida.*

### Morning: The Old Corkscrew
It’s a bit of a drive (Estero), but it’s the only Jack Nicklaus "Signature" non-residential course in the area. It is *hard*. It winds through pure nature—no houses, just trees and water.

<ExpertTip>
  **Summer Rates:** From May to October, greens fees drop by 70%. You can play $300 courses for $60. It will be hot, but empty.
