# The Grandparent Trap: A Multi-Gen Guide to Naples

Naples is one of the few destinations that truly caters to every generation equally. "Snowbirds" love it, and kids love the beach. The challenge is finding activities *everyone* can do together.

## Day 1: The Crowd Pleaser
*Ease into the trip with accessible activities.*

### Morning: Naples Botanical Garden
This is 100% ADA accessible, meaning strollers and wheelchairs roll easily.
*   **Why it works:** Kids love the splash pad, grandparents love the orchids and shaded benches. It’s beautiful for everyone.

### Lunch: Fogg Café
Eat right there at the Garden. Fresh, easy food with outdoor seating overlooking the grounds.

### Evening: Tin City
It’s touristy, but it works for groups. Browse the kitschy shops.
*   **Dinner:** **Riverwalk**. Ask for a table on the water. The menu is huge (fish, burgers, salads), so even picky eaters are happy.

---

## Day 2: Boat Day
*No walking required, maximum views.*

### Activity: Pontoon Boat Rental or Tour
Rent a large pontoon boat from **Naples Bay Resort** or take the **Naples Princess** cruise.
*   **The Win:** Everyone sits comfortably in the shade. You see the massive mansions of Port Royal. It’s luxurious but low-effort.

### Dinner: Venetian Village
Head to **The Village Shops on Venetian Bay**. It’s very walkable and safe.
*   **Eat:** **M Waterfront Grille**. Fantastic views, upscale but accommodates large groups if booked ahead.

## Day 3: Beach & trolley
*Sun and seeing the sights.*

### Morning: Clam Pass Park
Use the free tram system! This saves the grandparents from a long walk to the sand. There is a restaurant at the beach, so you don't need to haul coolers.

### Late Afternoon: Naples Trolley Tour
Hop on the vintage trolley. It loops the whole city. The narrator tells history/jokes (cheesy but fun). You can hop off at 5th Ave for dinner.

## Day 4: The Group Photo
*Making memories.*

### Morning: Revs Institute
For the grandfathers (and car lovers), **The Revs Institute** is a hidden gem. It houses one of the world's most impressive car collections. It’s indoor, air-conditioned, and fascinating.

### Farewell Dinner: Ridgway Bar & Grill
Located off 3rd Street. Included because Tony Ridgway is a local legend, and the patio is lovely for a large final family meal.
