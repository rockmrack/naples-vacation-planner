## Day 1: Arrival & Barefoot Elegance
*Check-in to your romantic haven and decompress immediately.*

### Afternoon: Check-In at LaPlaya or The Ritz-Carlton
For a honeymoon, you want direct beach access. We recommend **LaPlaya Beach & Golf Resort** for its boutique feel and tables right in the sand, or the newly renovated **Ritz-Carlton, Naples** for unmatched service.

<EditorNote>
  Request a beachfront room with a private balcony. At LaPlaya, the "Gulf View Beach House" rooms are incredibly romantic and feel like a private cottage.
</EditorNote>

### Evening: Sunset Dinner at Baleen
There is no restaurant more romantic in Naples than **Baleen** at LaPlaya. Reserve a table *on the sand* (yes, you can dine literally on the beach) about 30 minutes before sunset.

**What to Order:**
*   Chilled Seafood Tower to share
*   Black Grouper with truffle risotto
*   Champagne toast as the sun dips below the horizon

---

## Day 2: Spa bliss & Fifth Avenue Strolls
*Indulge in world-class wellness and the charm of Old Naples.*

### Morning: Couples Massage
Start your first full day with a 10:00 AM couples treatment.
*   **The Spa at The Ritz-Carlton**: World-famous for a reason. Their "Drift to Sleep" ritual is transformative.
*   **The Spa at Naples Grande**: A sanctuary of Japanese-inspired pavilions and tranquility.

### Lunch: French Charm at Bleu Provence
Head to 8th Street South for lunch at **Bleu Provence**. The courtyard garden is secluded and undeniably romantic. Their Provençal rosé list is the best in town.

### Afternoon: Shopping & Strolling 5th Avenue South
Walk hand-in-hand down 5th Avenue. Stop into **Naples Soap Company** for local bath bombs, browse the art galleries, and grab a gelato at **Regina's**.

### Evening: The Love Boat
Book a private sunset charter with **Naples Nantucket Charters**. You'll board a classic Hinckley yacht (the epitome of style) for a private 2-hour cruise through the mangroves and out to the Gulf. Bring your own playlist and let the captain handle the champagne.

---

## Day 3: Island Escape
*Adventure together to a private island.*

### Day Trip: Keewaydin Island
Rent a boat or take the **Hemingway Water Shuttle** to Keewaydin Island. It’s accessible only by boat, meaning fewer crowds and miles of shelling beaches.

<ExpertTip>
  Pack a picnic lunch from **Wynn's Market** before you go. Include their famous fried chicken, fresh fruit, and a bottle of crisp white wine.
</ExpertTip>

### Evening: Dinner on 3rd Street South
Tonight, dine at **Campiello** on 3rd Street South. The courtyard patio with its twinkling lights and live jazz is pure magic. 
*   **Must Order:** The pear and gorgonzola salad and the pappardelle with braised veal.

---

## Day 4: Farewell Brunch
*A lazy morning before you depart.*

### Brunch: Jane's Cafe on 3rd
Grab a table by the fountain at **Jane's Cafe**. It's quirky, colorful, and serves the best lobster benedict in town. It’s the perfect happy vibe to end your trip.

### Final Beach Walk
Take one last walk to the **Naples Pier** (or the beach alongside it) to snap that final honeymoon selfie.
