## Day 1: The Birds of the Swamp
*Long lenses and golden light.*

### Morning: Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary
Arrive at **Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary** (Audubon) right when gates open (usually 8 AM).
*   **The Shot:** The Painted Bunting (winter) and Barred Owls. The 2-mile boardwalk gives you elevation into the cypress forest.
*   **Lens:** 400mm+ recommended.

### Lunch: Everglades City
Drive south to Everglades City for fresh stone crab.

### Afternoon: Big Cypress Loop Road
Drive **Loop Road** (scenic highway). It’s a bumpy dirt road, but you will see dozens of alligators warming themselves on the banks just feet from your car.
*   **The Shot:** Gator close-ups and heron reflections.

## Day 2: Marine Life & Sunsets
*Dolphins and landscapes.*

### Morning: Gordon Pass
Position yourself on the jetty at **Gordon Pass** (access via Keewaydin or boat). This is the highway for dolphins entering and exiting the bay.
*   **The Shot:** Dolphins jumping in the wake of boats. 

### Late Afternoon: Tigertail Beach Lagoon
Wade across the lagoon at **Tigertail Beach** on Marco Island (check low tide!).
*   **The Shot:** The "Million Dollar Shot" is of the shorebirds (sandpipers, plovers) scuttling in the mirror-like tidal pools at golden hour. 
*   **Bonus:** You might see nesting Ospreys.

<EditorNote>
  Respect the wildlife. Use a zoom lens; never approach a nest or feed an alligator. It's illegal and dangerous.
