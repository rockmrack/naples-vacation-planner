# The Fork & Knife Tour: Naples for Foodies

Naples has the highest concentration of fine dining per capita in the country. But it’s not just white tablecloths; the strip mall gems and fish shacks are world-class too.

## Day 1: The Sea
*If it swims, we eat it.*

### Lunch: Swan River Seafood
It’s a fish market with a restaurant attached.
*   **Order:** The scorched crisp snapper or raw oysters. It’s fresh off the boat.

### Dinner: U.S.S. Nemo
An icon.
*   **The Dish:** Miso Broiled Sea Bass. It has been voted the best dish in Naples for years. It lives up to the hype.

---

## Day 2: The Land (and Italy)
*Naples has deep Italian roots.*

### Lunch: Bar Tulia (Mercato)
Gastro-pub vibe.
*   **Order:** The bucket of fried chicken (gourmet style) or the garganelli pasta.

### Dinner: Osteria Tulia
The big sister to Bar Tulia on 5th Ave. It’s rustic Italian farmhouse cooking.
*   **Order:** Cacio e Pepe. Simple, perfect.

---

## Day 3: The High End
*Dress up and splurge.*

### Brunch: Sails Restaurant
Their Sunday Champagne Brunch is legendary. Infinite courses, tiered trays, and bottomless Louis Roederer. It is an *event*.

### Dinner: The Grill at The Ritz-Carlton
Classic steakhouse perfection.
*   **Order:** The Dover Sole (deboned table-side) or the Dry Aged Ribeye. Finish with the Grand Marnier Soufflé.

<EditorNote>
  **Stone Crab Season:** October 15 - May 1. If you are here during these dates, eating stone crab claws is mandatory. **Truluck's** is the most reliable spot for them.
