<EditorNote type="info">
  **Romance Tip:** For the ultimate romantic experience, visit in **November or April**. The weather is perfect (75°F), but it's just outside the peak "high season" crowds of February.

## Imagine the Perfect 48 Hours
Naples was practically made for couples. It’s walkable, sophisticated, and centered around sunsets and dining. This itinerary skips the family spots (sorry, Zoo!) and focuses on connection, luxury, and great food.

<ProsCons 
  pros={[
    "Ambiance: Fairy-lit streets and garden courtyards everywhere",
    "Dining: The highest density of romantic restaurants in Florida",
    "Sunset Culture: Watching the sunset is a daily celebrated ritual"

  cons={[
    "Cost: Romantic dining on 5th Avenue comes with a price tag",
    "Nightlife: It’s more 'cocktail lounge' than 'nightclub' (which we love)"

## Day 1: Chic Streets & Sunset Sails
*Theme: Old Naples sophistication.*

### Morning: Coffee & The Avenues
Start slow. You're on island time.
*   **Coffee:** Walk to **Tony's Off Third**. Grab a pastry and sit in the courtyard by the fountain.
*   **The Stroll:** Walk hand-in-hand down **3rd Street South**. Peek into the art galleries and boutiques. It feels like a European village.

### Afternoon: Beach Picnic
Don't just go to the beach—do it right.
*   **Lunch:** Pick up a gourmet picnic basket from **Wynn's Market** or sandwiches from **Tony's**.
*   **The Spot:** Head to the beach at the end of **8th Avenue South**. It's quieter than the Pier area and has a beautiful grassy park (Wedding Park) right next to the sand.

### Evening: The Sunset Sail
This is non-negotiable for a romantic trip.
*   **Activity:** Board the *Sweet Liberty* or *Miss Naples* sailing catamaran.
*   **Ideally:** Bring a light jacket; it gets breezy on the water.
*   **The View:** Watching the sun dip below the horizon while sailing past the Port Royal mansions is unforgettable.

### Dinner: 5th Avenue South
*   **The Pick:** **Sails Restaurant**. It offers a "seafood tower" that is a showstopper.
*   **Alternative:** **The French**. Ask for a sidewalk table for prime people-watching.

## Day 2: Spa & Seclusion
*Theme: Deep relaxation.*

### Morning: Couples Wellness
*   **Option A:** Book a couples massage at the **Spa on Fifth** (Inn on Fifth). They have private balconies for post-treatment relaxing.
*   **Option B:** Walk the **Naples Botanical Garden**. The "Asian Garden" section with its tea house is incredibly peaceful and photogenic.

<ExpertTip author="Sarah">
  **Photo Op:** The "Mosiac Garden" at the Botanical Garden is the #1 spot for a cute couple's photo. Go before 11 AM for the best light.
</ExpertTip>

### Afternoon: Lovers Key State Park
Drive 20 mins north to **Lovers Key State Park**.
*   **Why:** It’s named Lovers Key for a reason. It used to be accessible only by boat.
*   **Do:** Rent a tandem kayak or just walk the 2.5 miles of untouched beach. It feels wild and secluded compared to Naples beach.

### Evening: Venetian Village
Head to **The Village Shops on Venetian Bay**.
*   **Atmosphere:** It’s built entirely over the water.
*   **Dinner:** **T-Michaels Steak & Lobster**. Request a window table. The view of the bay lights reflecting on the water is magical.

## Where to Stay for Romance

<Rating stars={5} label="Romance Score" />

*   **The Inn on Fifth (Club Level):** Adults-only rooftop deck, free evening cocktails, and right in the heart of the action.
*   **The Escalante:** A hidden tropical oasis at the end of 5th Avenue. It feels like a private villa.
*   **Edgewater Beach Hotel:** If you must be right on the sand. All suites, great for sipping wine on your balcony.

  {
    question: "Is it crowded?",
