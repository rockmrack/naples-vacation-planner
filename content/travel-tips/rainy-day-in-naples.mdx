## The Naples rain strategy

In warmer months, Naples often follows a simple pattern:

- clear mornings
- storms later in the day
- calmer evenings

So the best plan is:

1) schedule outdoor activities early
2) keep one indoor backup block ready

## Practical rainy-day ideas (mix and match)

### 1) Museums / galleries / shows

Aim for a 2–3 hour indoor block.

### 2) Shopping + a longer lunch

Turn a storm into an excuse for a relaxed meal.

### 3) Gardens (timing matters)

If rain is light or there’s a break between showers, a garden visit can still work—otherwise shift it to the next morning.
