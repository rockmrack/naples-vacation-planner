## Luxury for Less (Actually, for Zero)

Naples is known for wealth, but its best assets—nature and sunshine—are free. Here is how to fill your itinerary without opening your wallet.

## The Big Ones

1.  **Naples Pier**
    Walk the historic pier to watch dolphins, pelicans, and the sunset. (Fishing is free too—no license needed on the pier!)
    
2.  **Naples Depot Museum**
    Explore the restored 1927 train station and learn about the roaring 20s in Naples. Free admission.

3.  **The Beach**
    All beaches in Naples are public. While parking costs money, walking on the sand is free.
    *Tip: Walk/bike to the beach to skip the parking meter.*

4.  **Cambier Park Concerts**
    Enjoy free jazz and big band concerts on Sunday afternoons/evenings in season.

5.  **Sunset at the 'Avenues'**
    Head to the end of any Avenue (1st-13th Ave S) for a front-row seat to the sunset.

## Nature & Outdoors

6.  **Gordon River Greenway**
    A 2.5-mile paved path and boardwalk through mangroves. Perfect for biking/walking.

7.  **Bird Gardens of Naples**
    A parrot sanctuary in Corkscrew. Free tours (donation appreciated, reservation required).

8.  **Freedom Park**
    50 acres of restored wetlands with boardwalks. Great for spotting otters and herons.

11. **5th Avenue South Window Shopping**
    Stroll the most famous street in Naples. The lights at night are magical (especially Christmas).

    (Sat mornings). You don't have to buy anything to enjoy the vibe, music, and samples.

13. **Naples Preserve**
    Walk the boardwalk to see Gopher Tortoises. They are everywhere!

14. **Tin City**
    Walk through the historic waterfront buildings. Great for photos.

    See the "Swamp Buggies" and historic cottages. Free admission.

## Hidden Gems

16. **Oakes Farm Market**
    It's a grocery store, but it feels like a theme park for foodies. Go see the displays.

17. **Watch Planes at Naples Airport**
    There’s a viewing area to watch private jets land. Kids love it.

18. **Library Headquarters**
    The main library often has free art exhibits and spacious reading gardens.

19. **Shelling**
    Go early morning to find free souvenirs (shells!) on the beach.

20. **Celebration Park (Walk-through)**
    You can walk through and see the water without buying (though a drink is nice).
