## The "Naples Casual" Dress Code

Naples style is "upscale casual." You want to look put-together but comfortable.

- **Daytime:** Shorts, sundresses, polo shirts, sandals.
- **Evening:** Collared shirts/linen pants for men; nice dresses or slacks for women. Ties/jackets rarely needed unless at ultra-fine dining.

## What to Leave at Home

- **Heavy coats/boots:** Even in winter, a light jacket is enough.
- **Formal formal wear:** Tuxedos/gowns are for galas only.
- **High heels:** Hard to walk on docks/beach. Wedges are better.

  **Rain Gear:** If visiting June-September, bring a compact umbrella or light rain jacket. Afternoon showers are daily but brief.
