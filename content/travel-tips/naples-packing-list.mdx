<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "What should I wear to dinner in Naples?",
    answer: "Smart casual is the minimum for most 5th Avenue and 3rd Street restaurants. Men should bring at least one collared shirt. Women can wear sundresses or nice pants. Fine dining venues expect resort elegant—no shorts or flip-flops."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need bug spray in Naples?",
    answer: "Yes, especially in summer or if visiting the Everglades. Mosquitoes are active after rain and near mangroves. Picaridin-based sprays work well and are less greasy than DEET."

    answer: "Both! Days are beach casual but evenings, especially on 5th Avenue, are upscale. Pack for both—you'll want nice outfits for sunset dinners."
