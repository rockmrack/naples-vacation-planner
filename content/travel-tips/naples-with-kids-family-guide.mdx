## Is Naples Good for Families?
**100% Yes.** While it has a retirement reputation, Naples is incredibly safe, clean, and packed with high-quality family amenities.

## Top 5 Kid Activities

### 1. Golisano Children's Museum of Naples (C'MON)
World-class. Two stories of interactive exhibits including a VR Everglades experience and a climbing banyan tree. Perfect for rainy days.

### 2. Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens
Manageable size for toddlers. Access to almost all animals is very close.
*Highlight:* Feeding the giraffes (by hand!).

### 3. Sun-N-Fun Lagoon (Water Park)
(Check seasonal hours). Lazy river, slides, and a splash pad. Very affordable compared to Orlando parks.

### 4. Baker Park
The best park in the city. Huge grassy hills (rare in FL!), splash pad, bike paths, and a playground that looks like a spaceship.

### 5. Conservancy of Southwest Florida
Interactive nature center. Electric boat rides (included!) are great for seeing easy wildlife without hiking.

## Best Family Beaches

- **Lowdermilk Park:** Has a cafe (burgers/ice cream), playground, and restrooms.
- **Tigertail Beach (Marco):** The lagoon is shallow and flat—perfect for toddlers.
- **Delnor-Wiggins Pass:** Lots of shade trees near the beach (Area 3 or 4).

## Kid-Friendly Dining

- **Pinchers (Tin City):** Kids eat free (with adult entrée). Loud, fun, seafood.
- **Brooks Burgers:** Fun classic diner vibe. Even picky eaters love it.
- **Celebration Park:** Food trucks = everyone gets what they want.

<ExpertTip>
  **Stroller Rental:** Don’t haul it. Services like *BabyQuip* will deliver strollers, cribs, and beach gear to your rental.
