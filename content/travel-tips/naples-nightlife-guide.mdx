## Naples After Dark

Naples isn't a party town—it's sophisticated. Expect cocktail lounges, live jazz, and early nights rather than clubs.

## Downtown (5th Ave & 3rd St)

### 1. Burn by Rocky Patel
**Vibe:** Upscale cigar lounge with full bar.
**Best For:** Whiskey, cigars, gentleman's night.

### 2. Blue Martini (Mercato)
**Vibe:** Lively lounge, DJs, dancing.
**Best For:** The closest thing to a "club" in Naples.

### 3. Barbatella Bar
**Vibe:** Sophisticated Italian aperitivo.
**Order:** Negroni or spritz.

### 4. The French Bar
**Vibe:** Parisian cocktails, intimate.

## Casual & Fun

### 5. Pelican Larry's
**Vibe:** Sports bar, wings, beer.
**Best For:** Catching a game.

### 6. South Street City Oven

## Late Night Bites

- **Tacos Lupita** – Open late (Mexican).
- **24-Hour Diners** – Limited options; plan ahead.

---

## Reality Check

- Most bars close by midnight.
- "Late night" in Naples is 10 PM.
- No nightclubs in the Miami sense.

  **Where to Go:** Blue Martini for energy, Barbatella for sophistication, Pelican Larry's for casual.
