## From the Locals

After years of living here, Naples residents know the insider tricks. Here they are.

## Do This (Like a Local)

1. **Eat at the Bar**
   Naples' best restaurants (Osteria Tulia, Barbatella, USS Nemo) are walk-in friendly if you sit at the bar. Skip the 3-week reservation wait.

2. **Go Off-Peak**
   Beach at 4 PM (not noon). 5th Ave on Tuesday (not Saturday). Golf in summer (empty courses, half price).

3. **Skip the Big Resorts for Dinner**
   Hotel restaurants are fine, but the best food is downtown.

4. **Walk Gordon Drive**
   The mega-mansions of Port Royal. Free architecture tour. Jaw-dropping.

5. **Publix Subs**
   Seriously. Florida's famous sub sandwiches. Get a "Chicken Tender Pub Sub" and have a beach picnic.

## Skip This

1. **Taxis from the Airport**
   They're $100+. Use Uber/Lyft or rent a car.

2. **Chain Restaurants on US-41**
   You're in Naples. Eat local.

3. **The Pier at Peak Weekend**
   Go at sunrise or sunset on a weekday instead.

4. **Hurricane Season Panic**
   Most summers are fine. Just buy travel insurance.

## Blend In

- Say "Tamiami" (tah-mee-AH-mee), not "Tamy-ammy."
- Don't wear flip-flops to dinner on 5th Ave.
- Know that "The Ritz" means the Ritz-Carlton, not the crackers.

<ExpertTip>
  **Ultimate Local Move:** Sunday morning at 3rd Street Farmers Market → brunch at Jane's → walk home via beach. That's the Naples lifestyle.
