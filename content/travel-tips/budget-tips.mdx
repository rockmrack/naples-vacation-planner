## Top 5 Money-Saving Tips

1.  **Visit in Shoulder Season**
    May and October offer the best balance of lower prices (30-50% off hotels) and decent weather.

2.  **Beach Parking Hacks**
    - Most beach parking is $4/hour.
    - **Free Parking:** At the ends of some residential avenues in Old Naples (check signs carefully!) or walk from free garages downtown (4-5 blocks).
    - **Collier Beach Sticker:** If staying long-term, valuable.

3.  **Happy Hour Dining**
    Naples has *amazing* happy hours, often 3 PM - 6 PM.
    - **Ocean Prime, Truluck's, The French:** Get high-end food for half price in the bar area.
    - **Early Bird:** Many restaurants offer "Sunset Menus" if seated before 6 PM.

4.  **Free Activities**
    - **Beaches:** Always free access (just pay parking).
    - **Naples Pier:** Free to walk (and fish!).
    - **Naples Depot Museum:** Free admission.
    - **Conservancy of SWFL:** Often has free days/events.
    - **Window Shopping:** 5th Ave & 3rd St are free to stroll.

5.  **Stay Inland**
    Hotels 10-15 minutes inland (e.g., near I-75) can be 50% cheaper than beachfront resorts.

<ExpertTip>
  **Summer Golf:** From May-October, rounds at championship courses drop from $300+ to $50-80. It's hot, but a steal for golfers.
