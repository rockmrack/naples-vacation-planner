## The Three Seasons of Naples
Naples doesn't have Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. It has:
1.  **"Perfect" Season (Nov–April):** 75°F, sunny, dry. Expensive.
2.  **"Hothouse" Season (June–Sept):** 90°F, humid, rainy afternoons. Cheap.
3.  **"Shoulder" Season (May & Oct):** The transition. Great value.
