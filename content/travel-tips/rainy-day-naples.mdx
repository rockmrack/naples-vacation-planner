## First: Don't Panic

Rain in Naples is usually **not a big deal**. Here's what you need to know:

### The Reality of Naples Weather

- **Afternoon storms** (May–October) typically last 1–2 hours
- Morning is often clear—hit the beach early
- Storms usually roll through by sunset
- Winter (November–April) is mostly dry and sunny

**The move:** Check the hourly forecast. If rain is expected at 3pm, plan indoor activities for 2–5pm and catch sunset at the pier.
