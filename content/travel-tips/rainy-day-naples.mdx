<EditorNote type="info">
  **The "3 PM Rule":** In summer, it rains almost every day at 3 PM for exactly 60 minutes. Don't cancel your dinner plans. Wait it out; the sunset after a storm is usually the best one.
</EditorNote>

## Don't Panic. Pivot.
Rain in Naples is usually short, intense, and warm. But if you get a full "washout" day, don't just sit in the hotel room. Naples has surprisingly great indoor infrastructure.

<ProsCons 
  pros={[
    "Museums: The Baker Museum is world-class art, fully indoors.",
    "Shopping: Waterside Shops is open-air but has covered walkways everywhere.",
    "Relaxation: The sound of rain on a spa roof is unbeatable."

  cons={[
    "Water Parks: Sun-n-Fun Lagoon closes for lightning (obviously).",
    "Driving: Visibility during a tropical downpour can be near zero. Pull over."

## 4 Ways to Save the Day

### 1. The "Culture Vulture" (Artis-Naples)
Head to the **Baker Museum**.
*   **Why:** It’s a stunning three-story art museum.
*   **Highlights:** The Dale Chihuly glass ceiling (Persian Seaform) is Instagram gold.
*   **Bonus:** Catch a matinee performance by the Naples Philharmonic next door.

### 2. The "Movie Star" (Silverspot Cinema)
This isn't your local AMC. **Silverspot** at Mercato is luxury.
*   **The Experience:** Leather reclining seats, waiter service to your chair, and a full bar.
*   **The Move:** Order the truffle fries and a martini. Watch a 3-hour epic.

### 3. The "Kids Energy Burn" (C'mon Museum)
If you have toddlers, go to the **Golisano Children's Museum (C'mon)**.
*   **Why:** It’s huge, interactive, and fully air-conditioned. They can climb the banyan tree structure and tire themselves out.

### 4. The "Retail Therapy" (Coastland Center)
Waterside Shops is nicer, but if it's pouring, **Coastland Center** is a traditional indoor mall.
*   **Stores:** H&M, Macy's, and a decent food court (Cheesecake Factory nearby).

## Rainy Day Dining
Don't just go anywhere. Go somewhere cozy.
*   **The Cave Bistro:** Literally designed to look like a cave. No windows. Perfect for forgetting the weather.
*   **Bar Tulia:** Dark wood, warm lighting, incredible Italian gastropub food.

## FAQ

<FAQ items={[

  },
  {
    question: "Is it safe to drive?",
    answer: "Florida rain comes down HARD. If you can't see the car in front of you, put on your hazards and pull into a parking lot. It will pass in 15 mins."
