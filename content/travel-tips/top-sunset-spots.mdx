## Chasing the Green Flash

The Naples sunset is a daily ritual. While the **Naples Pier** is the crown jewel, it gets crowded. Here are 7 other spots to watch the show.

---

## 1. Lowdermilk Park
**Why:** More parking, picnic tables, and a concession stand.
**Vibe:** Family friendly, lively.

## 2. Turtle Club / Vanderbilt Beach
**Why:** Grab a cocktail at the Turtle Club (if open) or just sit on the wide sands of Vanderbilt Beach.
**Vibe:** Upscale bustling.

## 3. Clam Pass Park
**Why:** The boardwalk through the mangroves builds anticipation. The pass itself has rushing water and panoramic views.
**Vibe:** Nature-focused.

## 4. The "Avenues"
**Why:** Drive to the end of any Avenue (e.g., 2nd Ave N, 3rd Ave N) in Old Naples. There are small beach accesses with benches.
**Vibe:** Quiet, romantic, intimate.

## 5. Gordon River Greenway (Bridge)
**Why:** A different perspective. Watch the sun set over the mangroves and river from the pedestrian bridge.
**Vibe:** Active, peaceful.

## 6. Sugden Regional Park
**Why:** Sunset over a freshwater lake (Lake Avalon).
**Vibe:** calm, different from the beach.

## 7. Sunset Beach Bar (Naples Grande)
**Why:** Food, drinks, and socializing while the sun goes down.

<ExpertTip>
  **The Green Flash:** Watch the very top edge of the sun as it dips below the Gulf horizon. On clear days, you might see a split-second flash of emerald green. It's real!
