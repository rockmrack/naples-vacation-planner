<EditorNote type="warning">
  **Airport Tip:** Do NOT take a taxi from RSW (Fort Myers Airport) to Naples. It can cost $100+. Uber/Lyft is cheaper ($40-60), but renting a car at the airport is often the most economical move for a week-long trip.

## The Short Answer: Yes (Mostly)
Naples is spread out. It is a suburban beach town, not a dense city like NYC or Chicago. Unless you plan to stay in one hotel and never leave, **you probably need a car.**

### When You Can Skip the Car:
*   **You are staying in Old Naples:** And you only plan to eat on 5th Ave and lie on the beach.
*   **You are at a Full Resort:** If you are at the Ritz or Naples Grande and just want pool/beach/spa, you're fine.

### When You Definitely Need a Car:
*   **You have kids:** Hauling beach gear to Lowdermilk Park requires a trunk.
*   **You want to explore:** Everglades, Marco Island, and Mercato are all 20+ minute drives apart.
*   **You are staying in an Airbnb:** Most rentals are in residential neighborhoods, not walking distance to the beach.

## Getting Around Without Wheels

### Rideshare (Uber/Lyft)
*   **Availability:** Excellent. You will rarely wait more than 10 mins.
*   **Cost:** A trip from Old Naples to Mercato (North Naples) is ~$25 each way. If you do that daily, a rental car is cheaper.

### The "Slidr" (Downtown Only)
*   **What is it?** A free electric golf cart shuttle service that operates in the Old Naples / 5th Ave area.
*   **How to use:** Download the Slidr app. It's great for getting from your hotel to dinner.

### Free Beach Trams
*   **Pelican Bay / Clam Pass:** These areas have free trams from the parking lots to the sand.

## Rental Car Strategy
*   **The Model:** Naples is the land of convertibles. If you ever wanted to rent a Mustang or Jeep, this is the place.
*   **Parking:**
    *   **5th Avenue:** Almost all street parking is FREE (but limited time). Parking garages are also free and plentiful.
    *   **Beaches:** You pay to park at the beach ($4-10/hr). Most machines take credit cards.
    *   **Hotels:** Many high-end hotels charge for valet ($30+/night). Check your booking!
