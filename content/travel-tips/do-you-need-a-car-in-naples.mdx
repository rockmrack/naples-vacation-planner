## When You DON'T Need a Car

### ✅ Staying in Old Naples + Walking Everywhere

If you:
- Stay in **Old Naples** (near 5th Ave or 3rd Street)
- Plan to walk to beaches, shops, and restaurants
- Skip day trips to Everglades or Marco Island
- Are comfortable with occasional rideshare

Then you can likely skip a car.

**What's walkable from Old Naples:**
- Naples Pier and beach (10-15 min walk)
- 5th Avenue South dining
- 3rd Street South shopping
- Lowdermilk Park beach (15-20 min walk)

### ✅ Staying at a Full-Service Resort

Resorts like **The Ritz-Carlton** or **Naples Grande** offer:
- Beach access on-site
- Multiple restaurants
- Shuttle service to nearby attractions
- Concierge-arranged tours

You can enjoy a full vacation without ever renting a car—if you're okay staying within the resort ecosystem.

## When You NEED a Car

### ❌ Day Trips (Everglades, Marco Island, Sanibel)

These destinations have **no public transit** from Naples:
- Everglades City: 45 min drive
- Marco Island: 20-30 min drive
- Fort Myers / Sanibel: 45-60 min drive

If your trip includes nature adventures or island hopping, you need a car.

### ❌ Beach Variety

Want to visit **Vanderbilt Beach, Delnor-Wiggins Pass, or Tigertail Beach**? You'll need transportation. These beaches are 15-30 minutes from downtown Naples.

### ❌ Families with Kids

Hauling strollers, beach gear, coolers, and tired kids = car is essential.

### ❌ Staying in North Naples (Vanderbilt, Pelican Bay)

These areas are less walkable. You'll need a car to reach downtown dining and attractions.

## Alternatives to Renting a Car

### 🚕 Rideshare (Uber/Lyft)

- Available in Naples
- Works well for occasional trips
- Can get expensive for daily use
- Good for: airport transfers, occasional outings

### 🚕 Taxis

- Traditional taxi service exists
- Less convenient than rideshare
- Often used for airport transfers

### 🚌 Collier Area Transit (CAT)

- Public buses exist but routes are limited
- Not practical for most tourist activities
- More useful for residents

### 🚲 Biking

- Naples has bike-friendly areas
- Good for: exploring Old Naples, short distances
- Not practical for: visiting distant beaches or day trips

---

## Cost Comparison

| Option | Daily Cost (Estimate) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Rental car | $50-100/day |
| Rideshare (3-4 trips) | $40-80/day |
| Walking only | Free |
| Bike rental | $20-40/day |

**If you'll use rideshare more than 2-3 times per day, a rental car becomes more cost-effective.**

---

## Our Recommendation by Trip Style

### Weekend Getaway (Old Naples focus)
**Skip the car.** Walk everywhere, use rideshare for longer distances.

### Beach Vacation (3-5 days)
**Rent a car.** You'll want flexibility to visit different beaches and explore.

### Family Trip
**Definitely rent a car.** Kids + gear + flexibility = car is essential.

### Day Trip Heavy (Everglades, Marco, etc.)
**Rent a car.** No practical alternatives for reaching these destinations.

### Resort Stay
**Maybe skip it.** Check what your resort offers and plan accordingly.
