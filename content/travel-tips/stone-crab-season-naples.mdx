<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "When is stone crab season in Naples, Florida?",
    answer: "Stone crab season runs from October 15 to May 15 annually. The best quality is typically November through January when the water is coldest and the meat is sweetest."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are stone crabs so expensive?",
    answer: "Stone crabs are wild-caught, not farmed. Only legal-size claws can be harvested, the crabs must be returned alive, and they're highly labor-intensive to catch. Supply is limited and demand is extremely high."
  },
  {
    question: "What sauce do you eat with stone crabs?",
    answer: "The traditional sauce is mustard sauce—a creamy blend of mayonnaise and mustard (often with Worcestershire and horseradish). Drawn butter is also popular. Cocktail sauce is considered a faux pas by locals!"
  },
  {
    question: "Can you eat stone crab claws hot?",
    answer: "Traditionally, stone crabs are served cold because they're cooked immediately after harvest. Some restaurants offer warm preparations, but cold with mustard sauce is the classic Naples way."
  }
