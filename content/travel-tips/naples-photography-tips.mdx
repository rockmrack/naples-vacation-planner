## Light Conditions

### Golden Hour (Best Light)
- **Morning:** 30 min after sunrise. Soft, warm.
- **Evening:** 1 hour before sunset. Magical at the pier.

### Midday
- Harsh shadows. Better for underwater or shaded areas.
- Use for Botanical Garden (dappled light is still nice).

### Blue Hour
- 20-30 min after sunset. Deep blue sky, lights turning on.
- Perfect for 5th Avenue with holiday lights.
