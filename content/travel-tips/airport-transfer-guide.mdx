**Time:** 40-50 min (depending on traffic).
**Tip:** Request at the rideshare pickup area on the lower level.
**Warning:** Do NOT take a taxi—often $100+.

### 3. Private Shuttle / Town Car
**Cost:** ~$75-120 for private sedan.
**Companies:** Naples Express, A1 Shuttle, Checker Cab.
**Best For:** Larger groups, celebrities avoiding Uber.

### 4. Hotel Shuttle
