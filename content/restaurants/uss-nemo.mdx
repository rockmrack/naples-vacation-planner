## A Naples Institution

Don't let the strip mall location fool you—USS Nemo has been serving some of Naples' most creative and flavorful seafood since 1996. This intimate, 50-seat restaurant consistently ranks among the city's best dining experiences.

## The Signature Dish

The **miso-glazed sea bass** isn't just a menu item—it's the reason many diners return again and again. The combination of sweet white miso glaze and perfectly cooked Chilean sea bass has achieved near-legendary status in Naples dining circles.

## The Menu

While the sea bass is the star, the entire menu showcases Chef Alexander Bernard's innovative approach to seafood:

- **Pan-Seared Diver Scallops:** Perfectly caramelized, served with seasonal accompaniments
- **Lobster Tempura:** Light, crispy, and decadent
- **Fresh Catch:** Daily specials based on what's fresh from local waters

## Atmosphere

The compact dining room creates an intimate experience with dark wood, nautical accents, and attentive service. It's the kind of place where you'll want to linger over dessert—especially the famous **white chocolate bread pudding**.
