## The Heart of 3rd Street South

Campiello has been a cornerstone of Naples' dining scene for over two decades. Its prime location on 3rd Street South, combined with consistently excellent Italian cuisine, makes it one of the most sought-after reservations in town.

## The Courtyard

The jewel of Campiello is its expansive outdoor courtyard, named one of Naples' best outdoor dining experiences. Surrounded by lush landscaping and twinkling lights, it transforms dinner into an event. During peak season, this is the table everyone wants.

## The Food

The menu celebrates rustic Italian cooking with modern refinement:

### Must-Try Dishes
- **Wood-Fired Pizzas:** Crispy, charred, authentic Neapolitan style
- **Osso Buco:** Fall-off-the-bone braised veal shank
- **Handmade Ravioli:** Rotating seasonal fillings
- **Bistecca Fiorentina:** 32oz Florentine-style T-bone for two

### Sunday Brunch
The Sunday brunch is legendary—think eggs Benedict with Italian twists, fresh pastries, and bottomless mimosas served in the sunny courtyard.

## Wine & Cocktails

The bar program shines with craft Italian cocktails (the Aperol Spritz is perfect for warm evenings) and an extensive Italian wine list. The outdoor bar is a scene unto itself for pre-dinner drinks.

## Tips for Visiting

- **Outdoor courtyard fills fast:** Request it when booking
- **Happy hour:** 4-6pm weekdays with small plates and drink specials
- **Parking:** Street parking on 3rd Street or nearby garage
- **Dress:** Smart casual, Naples style
