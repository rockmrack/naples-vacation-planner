## European Elegance on 5th Avenue

Sails Restaurant brings a touch of European glamour to downtown Naples. With its swanky art deco decor, impeccable tableside service, and show-stopping seafood presentations, this is the restaurant for those seeking a memorable luxury dining experience.

## The Grand Seafood Tower

The signature dish at Sails is the **Grand Seafood Tower**—a magnificent multi-tiered presentation of oysters, stone crab, shrimp, lobster, and more. It's as photogenic as it is delicious, and a must-order for first-time visitors.

## Tableside Showmanship

Sails elevates dining to theater with its tableside preparations:

- **Dover Sole:** Expertly filleted at your table
- **Caesar Salad:** Prepared fresh with a flourish
- **Beef Wellington:** Carved to reveal the perfect medium-rare

## The Menu Highlights

- **Lobster Thermidor:** Classic French preparation
- **Chateaubriand for Two:** Prime beef, tableside carved
- **Whole Mediterranean Fish:** Market fresh, simply grilled

## The Atmosphere

The interior channels a 1920s supper club with dark woods, brass accents, and crisp white linens. The outdoor patio offers prime people-watching on 5th Avenue.

## Worth the Splurge

Sails is one of Naples' most expensive restaurants, but for a special celebration, the experience justifies the price. Expect to spend $100-200 per person with wine.

- **Dress code:** Elegant casual to dressy
- **Reservations:** Essential, especially for outdoor seating
- **Occasion:** Anniversary, birthday, proposal—this is the spot
