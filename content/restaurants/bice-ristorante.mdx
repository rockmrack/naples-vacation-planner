## Milan Meets Naples

BiCE brings the sophistication of Milan's renowned dining tradition to Florida's Naples. The menu balances classic Italian preparations with contemporary touches.

## Must-Order

The **Tagliolini Lobster** is the signature dish—delicate fresh pasta with lobster, cherry tomatoes, and a touch of cream. It's what regulars come back for again and again.

## The Menu

- **Carpaccio:** Paper-thin beef, perfectly dressed
- **Veal Milanese:** Pounded thin, pan-fried crispy
- **Fresh Pastas:** Made in-house daily
- **Branzino:** Whole fish, Mediterranean-style

## Location Perfect

Right on 5th Avenue with excellent outdoor seating, BiCE is ideal for lunch while shopping or dinner before a gallery walk.

## Tips

- **Lunch specials:** Great value
- **Outdoor seating:** Request when booking
- **Modern vibe:** More contemporary than traditional
