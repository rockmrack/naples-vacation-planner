## Fresh Fish, Your Way

Randy's Fishmarket is unique in Naples—part retail fish market, part casual restaurant. Browse the display case of the day's fresh catches, then either take it home or have the kitchen prepare it for you on the spot.

## The Concept

The front of the house features a gleaming fish case filled with the day's arrivals: grouper, snapper, mahi-mahi, stone crab, shrimp, and more. Point to what looks good, and the kitchen will prepare it grilled, blackened, fried, or any way you like.

## Restaurant Highlights

- **Catch of the Day:** Whatever's freshest, cooked to order
- **Stone Crab Claws:** In season, competitive prices
- **Fish Tacos:** Fresh, generous, delicious
- **New England Clam Chowder:** Award-winning recipe

## The Market

Beyond the restaurant, the market sells fresh fish, prepared salads, sauces, and everything you need for a seafood dinner at your vacation rental.

## Why It Works

- **Transparency:** You see exactly what you're getting
- **Freshness:** Daily deliveries, never frozen
- **Value:** Restaurant-quality at market prices
- **Flexibility:** Eat in or take out

## Tips

- **Lunch is quieter:** Dinner can get busy
- **Seasonal specials:** Ask about what just came in
- **Takeout popular:** Great for beach picnics
