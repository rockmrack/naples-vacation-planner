## Stone Crab Royalty

When stone crab season opens in October, Truluck's becomes the destination for the freshest claws in Southwest Florida. As one of the few restaurants that harvests their own stone crab from their own boats, the quality is unmatched.

## The Stone Crab Experience

Stone crab claws arrive cold, pre-cracked, and served with Truluck's signature mustard sauce. The meat is sweet, tender, and utterly addictive. Order by the pound—you'll want more than you think.

**Season:** October 15 - May 15

Outside of stone crab season, the menu still shines with king crab, Alaskan snow crab, and exceptional seafood preparations.

## Beyond Crab

While crab is the star, the menu offers much more:

- **Jumbo Lump Crab Cake:** All crab, perfectly seasoned
- **Miso-Glazed Seabass:** A nod to their Texas roots
- **Prime Steaks:** For the carnivores at the table
- **Lobster Tail:** Australian cold water, butter-poached

## The Atmosphere

Elegant without being stuffy, Truluck's features dark woods, white tablecloths, and impeccable service. The bar scene is lively early evening—a great spot for raw bar appetizers and craft cocktails.

## Planning Your Visit

- **Reservations recommended:** Especially during stone crab season
- **Dress code:** Business casual to dressy
- **Price point:** This is a splurge—budget $75-150 per person
- **Valet parking:** Available
- **Private dining:** Excellent for groups and celebrations
