## A Naples Breakfast Institution

For over three decades, Jane's Cafe has been serving napkins-in-laps breakfast and lunch in one of Naples' most charming settings. The lush garden courtyard, complete with fountains and tropical plants, makes every meal feel like an escape.

## The Setting

The magic of Jane's is the courtyard—dappled sunlight filtering through banyan trees, the gentle splash of a fountain, and the leisurely pace of a true Naples morning. It's the antidote to rushed breakfast counters.

## The Menu

Breakfast and lunch are served all day:

### Breakfast Favorites
- **Eggs Benedict:** Classic, with Canadian bacon and hollandaise
- **Garden Omelet:** Loaded with fresh vegetables
- **Quiche du Jour:** Buttery crust, fresh fillings
- **Belgian Waffles:** Light, crispy, with fruit and cream

### Lunch Options
- **Signature Salads:** Creative, generous, garden-fresh
- **Sandwiches:** On house-baked breads
- **Soup of the Day:** Always homemade

## The Juice Bar

Don't miss the fresh-squeezed juices—the orange juice is phenomenal, and the smoothies are made with real fruit.

## Visiting Tips

- **No reservations:** First come, first served
- **Peak times:** 9-11am weekends can have waits
- **Arrive early:** For best courtyard seating
- **Cash accepted:** But cards preferred
- **Closed for dinner:** Breakfast and lunch only
