## Bay Views and Fresh Catches

Fish Restaurant combines the best of Naples' waterfront dining with a comprehensive menu spanning fresh seafood, high-quality sushi, and prime steaks. The setting on Venetian Bay adds a magical backdrop, especially at sunset.

## The Sushi Bar

The sushi program at Fish rivals dedicated Japanese restaurants:

- **Fresh Rolls:** Daily chef's specials featuring Gulf catches
- **Sashimi Platters:** Premium cuts, beautiful presentation
- **Omakase:** Available for adventurous diners

## Seafood & More

Beyond sushi, the kitchen excels at:

- **Fresh Catch:** Prepared your way—grilled, blackened, or sautéed
- **Lobster Roll:** Maine lobster, lightly dressed
- **Stone Crab:** In season, among the best in town
- **Prime Steaks:** For those who prefer surf to turf

## The Setting

The Village at Venetian Bay is one of Naples' most picturesque shopping and dining destinations. Fish's outdoor terrace overlooks the bay, with pelicans, boats, and sunset views included free of charge.

## Plan Ahead

- **Reservations recommended:** Especially for waterfront seating
- **Lunch is easier:** Less crowded than dinner
- **Parking:** Free in Village lot
- **Shopping nearby:** Perfect for pre-dinner browsing
