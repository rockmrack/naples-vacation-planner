## Lively 5th Avenue Energy

Chops City Grill brings a lively, urban energy to Naples' 5th Avenue. It's where the after-work crowd gathers, where celebrations happen, and where steaks are served with personality.

## The Steaks

Prime beef, expertly prepared:
- **Prime Ribeye:** Richly marbled
- **Filet Mignon:** Butter-tender
- **NY Strip:** Classic steakhouse cut
- **All steaks:** Cooked to your specification

## Beyond Beef

- **Lobster Tail:** Cold water, generous portion
- **Fresh Fish:** Daily specials
- **Crispy Calamari:** Perfect appetizer

## The Vibe

More fun and energetic than traditional steakhouses. The bar area is particularly lively, and the outdoor seating on 5th Avenue is prime people-watching territory.

## Tips

- **Bar scene:** Great for solo dining
- **Happy hour:** Strong cocktails, good prices
- **Groups welcome:** Good for celebrations
