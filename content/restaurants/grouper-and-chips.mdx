## No Frills, All Flavor

Grouper & Chips is the antidote to Naples' upscale dining scene. This no-frills counter-service spot serves what may be the best fried grouper in Southwest Florida at prices that won't break the bank.

## The Star: Grouper

The grouper is fresh, never frozen, and fried to golden perfection:

- **Grouper Basket:** Generous portion with fries and slaw
- **Grouper Sandwich:** On a soft bun with tartar sauce
- **Grilled Grouper:** For lighter appetites

## Stone Crab Season

From October to May, the stone crab claws here are fresh, properly served cold, and significantly cheaper than fancy restaurants. It's where many locals come for their stone crab fix.

## The Experience

Order at the counter, grab a number, and wait for your food. The dining room is basic—plastic chairs, paper plates—but no one cares when the food is this good.

## Why Locals Love It

- **Fresh fish:** Naples' freshest at this price point
- **No pretense:** Come as you are
- **Quick:** In and out in 30 minutes
- **Value:** Full meal under $20

## Tips

- **Cash preferred:** Credit cards accepted with minimum
- **Get there early:** Popular lunch spot, lines form
- **Closed Sundays:** Plan accordingly
- **Takeout-friendly:** Great for beach picnics
