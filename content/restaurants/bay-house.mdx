## Sunset Over Naples Bay

The Bay House offers one of Naples' most stunning dining views. Perched on the edge of Naples Bay, the restaurant provides panoramic water views from nearly every table.

## Gulf-to-Table

The kitchen emphasizes fresh, local seafood:
- **Fresh Gulf Catch:** Daily selection, chef's preparation
- **Stone Crab Claws:** In season, exceptionally fresh
- **Jumbo Shrimp:** Gulf-caught, simply prepared
- **Prime Steaks:** For non-seafood lovers

## The Setting

Floor-to-ceiling windows maximize the view. The outdoor terrace is especially magical at sunset, with boats gliding by and the sky turning golden.

## Special Occasions

This is where Naples comes to celebrate:
- **Proposals:** Sunset tables are legendary
- **Anniversaries:** Romantic and memorable
- **Milestone birthdays:** Worth the splurge

## Reservations Essential

Book early, especially for sunset tables and during season. The view table requests are highly competitive.
