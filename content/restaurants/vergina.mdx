## Mediterranean Heart of 5th Avenue

Vergina has been a 5th Avenue South mainstay for years, offering a lively mix of Italian and Mediterranean dishes in one of downtown's best people-watching locations.

The outdoor terrace is the place to be—table after table of diners enjoying the parade of 5th Avenue strollers. It's casual elegance, Naples-style.

## The Menu

A blend of Italian and broader Mediterranean influences:

### Highlights
- **Lamb Chops:** Tender, flavorful, a crowd favorite
- **Whole Branzino:** Mediterranean sea bass, simply grilled
- **Seafood Pasta:** Generous, flavorful, satisfying
- **Wood-Fired Pizza:** Crispy, charred, delicious
