## Sizzling at 500 Degrees

The Ruth's Chris signature: steaks arrive on 500-degree plates, sizzling in butter. It's theatrical, it's delicious, and it's consistently excellent across their locations.

## The Steaks

USDA Prime, custom-aged for tenderness:
- **Ribeye:** The most popular, richly marbled
- **Filet Mignon:** Buttery tender
- **Cowboy Ribeye:** Bone-in, extra impressive
- **Tomahawk:** The showstopper for sharing

## Classic Sides

The sides here are legendary:
- **Creamed Spinach:** Decadent, indulgent
- **Potatoes au Gratin:** Cheesy perfection
- **Lobster Mac & Cheese:** Over-the-top good

## The Experience

Classic steakhouse ambiance with dark wood, leather, and white tablecloths. The service is formal but friendly, and the wine list is extensive.

## Perfect For

- **Celebrations:** Birthdays, anniversaries, promotions
- **Business dinners:** Reliable, impressive
- **Steak purists:** Consistent excellence
