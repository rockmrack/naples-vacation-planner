## Refined Italian with Local Soul

MiraMare brings refined Neapolitan traditions to Naples, Florida. The chef's commitment to hyper-local sourcing means menus change with the seasons, and the daily catch truly is caught that day.

## The Seafood

Italian seafood preparations shine here:
- **Branzino:** The Mediterranean sea bass, simply grilled
- **Lobster Risotto:** Creamy, rich, perfumed with saffron
- **Fresh Pasta with Shellfish:** Rotating daily specials

## Beyond the Sea

For non-seafood lovers:
- **Veal Piccata:** Tender, lemony, classic
- **Osso Buco:** Slow-braised to perfection
- **Prime Steaks:** Italian preparations

## Atmosphere

Elegant without being stuffy, MiraMare creates an intimate dining experience with soft lighting, white linens, and attentive service. The outdoor terrace is lovely on pleasant evenings.

## Tips

- **Reservations recommended:** Intimate space fills quickly
- **Dress code:** Smart casual to dressy
- **Closed Mondays:** Plan accordingly
