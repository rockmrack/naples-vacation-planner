## Old Florida, New Fun

The Dock at Crayton Cove captures the essence of casual Naples waterfront dining. Perched at the edge of Naples City Dock, this laid-back spot offers marina views, unpretentious food, and the perfect vibe for watching boats and pelicans.

## The Vibe

This isn't white-tablecloth dining—The Dock is flip-flops, cold beer, and sunset toasts. The outdoor deck puts you right on the water, with fishing boats and yachts coming and going throughout the day.

## The Food

Casual American fare with a focus on fresh seafood:

- **Dock Nachos:** Piled high, feeds 2-4 easily
- **Fish Tacos:** Fresh catch, available grilled or blackened
- **Grouper Sandwich:** Local fish, simply prepared
- **Burgers:** Solid, straightforward, satisfying

## Happy Hour

The Dock is legendary for happy hour:
- **When:** 3-6pm daily
- **What:** Discounted drinks, $2 off appetizers
- **Where:** Best on the deck overlooking the marina

## Perfect for Families

Kids love watching the boats and pelicans. The casual atmosphere means no one cares if little ones are restless, and the menu has plenty of familiar options.

## Location Tips

- **Parking:** Limited at the dock, more in nearby lots
- **By boat:** Dock and dine at the City Dock marina
- **Walk from 5th Ave:** Pleasant 10-minute stroll
- **Sunset:** Peak time, be prepared for waits
