## A Taste of Old Florida

Kelly's Fish House has been serving fresh seafood on Naples Bay since 1953. It's a window into what Naples was before the high-rises and designer boutiques—a fishing village with fresh catch and Old Florida charm.

## The History

Family-owned for generations, Kelly's maintains the traditions of classic Florida seafood dining. The view of Naples Bay, the pelicans, and the working waterfront haven't changed in decades.

## The Seafood

Simple, fresh, and classic:
- **Fresh Fish:** Whatever's running, simply prepared
- **Stone Crab Claws:** In season, exceptionally fresh
- **Fried Shrimp:** Gulf-caught, golden-fried
- **Whole Fried Fish:** Old Florida tradition

## The Experience

This isn't modern fine dining—it's wooden tables, checkered tablecloths, and no-fuss service. The charm is in its authenticity.

## Tips

- **Cash only:** They do not accept credit cards
- **Early dinner:** Opens at 4pm, popular with locals
- **View tables:** Get there early for bay-front seating
- **Casual dress:** Come as you are
