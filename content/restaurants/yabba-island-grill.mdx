## Island Vibes on 5th Avenue

Yabba Island Grill brings tropical flavors and Caribbean energy to downtown Naples. It's a welcome departure from Italian and steakhouse standards, offering bold flavors and a festive atmosphere.

## The Cuisine

Caribbean-inspired with fresh Gulf seafood:
- **Jamaican Jerk Chicken:** Authentic spice, perfect heat
- **Coconut Shrimp:** Crispy, sweet, addictive
- **Island Fish Tacos:** Fresh catch with tropical slaw
- **Caribbean Lobster:** When available, spectacular

## The Bar

The rum program is serious—dozens of rums, creative tropical cocktails, and bartenders who know their way around a mojito. It feels like vacation even if you're already on vacation.

## The Vibe

Colorful, lively, and fun. The decor is tropical without being cheesy, and the energy is upbeat. It's a great spot for groups looking for something different.

## Tips

- **Outdoor seating:** Great for warm evenings
- **Happy hour:** Strong drink specials
- **Groups welcome:** Fun for celebrations
