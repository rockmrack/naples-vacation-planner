## Naples' Classic Breakfast

Sunburst Cafe has been fueling Naples mornings since 1989. No frills, no fancy—just solid breakfast and lunch at honest prices with friendly service.

## The Breakfast

Classic American breakfast done right:
- **Eggs Any Style:** Fresh, cooked perfectly
- **Pancakes:** Fluffy stacks, real maple syrup
- **Omelets:** Generously filled, made to order
- **Corned Beef Hash:** House-made, crispy edges
- **Eggs Benedict:** Classic preparation

## Lunch Too

While breakfast is the star, the lunch menu doesn't disappoint. Sandwiches, burgers, and salads are all reliable choices.

## The Experience

This is a diner in the best sense—formica tables, friendly waitresses who call you "hon," and coffee that never runs out. It's the opposite of trendy, and that's the point.

## Tips

- **Get there early:** Popular with locals
- **Weekend waits:** Common during season
- **Cash preferred:** They do take cards
- **Closes at 2:30pm:** Breakfast and lunch only
