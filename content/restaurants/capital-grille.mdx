## The Gold Standard of Steakhouses

The Capital Grille in Naples' Mercato district delivers exactly what you'd expect from one of America's premier steakhouse chains: perfectly dry-aged beef, attentive service, and an extraordinary wine program.

## The Beef

All steaks are dry-aged in-house for a minimum of 21 days, developing intense flavor and buttery tenderness:

- **Dry-Aged NY Strip (16oz):** The classic choice
- **Bone-In Ribeye (24oz):** Rich, marbled, unforgettable
- **Filet Mignon (8oz):** Fork-tender perfection
- **Porterhouse (24oz):** Best of both worlds

## Beyond Steak

While beef is the star, don't overlook:

- **Lobster Mac & Cheese:** Decadent side dish (or entrée)
- **Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon:** Light but satisfying
- **Lobster and Crab Cakes:** Excellent starters

## The Wine Program

With 350+ wines and a Wine Spectator Grand Award, the wine program is exceptional. The sommelier can guide you to the perfect pairing, whether you prefer a bold Napa Cabernet or a refined Burgundy.

## Location & Atmosphere

The Mercato location offers patio seating overlooking the upscale shopping district. Inside, the classic steakhouse decor—dark wood, leather, white linens—creates an atmosphere of refined success.
