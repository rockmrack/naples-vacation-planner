## Farm-Fresh, Neighborhood Feel

The Local has become a neighborhood staple for diners seeking thoughtfully-sourced ingredients and creative, seasonal menus. Off the beaten tourist path, this is where Naples residents go for a consistently excellent meal.

## The Philosophy

Chef sources from local farms, fishermen, and purveyors whenever possible. The menu changes with the seasons, but always features comfort food elevated with quality ingredients.

## Dinner Favorites

- **Roasted Half Chicken:** Simple, perfect, with seasonal sides
- **Braised Short Rib:** Fork-tender, deeply flavorful
- **Fresh Catch:** Whatever's best from local waters
- **The Local Burger:** Ground in-house, exceptional

## Sunday Brunch

The Sunday brunch has a devoted following:

- **Farm Eggs Benedict:** Poached eggs, ham, hollandaise
- **Chicken & Waffles:** Because why not
- **Seasonal Frittata:** Different every week
- **Bloody Mary Bar:** Build your own

## The Bar

Craft cocktails take center stage at the well-stocked bar. The bartenders know their stuff andwill happily customize drinks to your taste.

## Worth the Drive

While not in the downtown tourist area, The Local is worth the 10-minute drive for a more authentic Naples dining experience. Parking is easy, and reservations are recommended but not always essential.
