## Dining with Your Toes in the Sand

The Turtle Club offers what few restaurants can—fine dining directly on the beach. Located at the northern end of Vanderbilt Beach, this beloved Naples institution serves upscale seafood with unobstructed Gulf of Mexico views.

## The Setting

Request a table on the outdoor terrace for the full experience. As the sun sets over the Gulf, the sky transforms into a canvas of oranges, pinks, and purples—a nightly show that rivals any entertainment. Arrive early enough to walk the beach before dinner.

## The Menu

Fresh, locally-sourced seafood takes center stage:

- **Pan-Roasted Sea Bass:** A house specialty with seasonal preparations
- **Turtle Club Crab Cakes:** All jumbo lump, minimal filler, maximum flavor
- **Stone Crab Claws:** In season (October-May), the freshest in Naples
- **Prime Ribeye:** For those who prefer surf to turf

## Sunset Strategy

The key to a perfect Turtle Club experience:

1. **Book 4-6 weeks ahead** for prime sunset seating during season
2. **Request outdoor terrace** when making reservations
3. **Arrive 30 minutes early** to enjoy a cocktail on the beach
4. **Dress smart casual**—collared shirts for men suggested

## Practical Notes

- **Parking:** Valet available ($10)
- **Access:** Through the Vanderbilt Beach Resort
- **Lunch available:** More casual, easier reservations
- **Private events:** Beautiful for rehearsal dinners and celebrations
