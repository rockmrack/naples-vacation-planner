## Naples' Premier Rooftop Experience

Cavo Lounge offers what few Naples spots can—rooftop dining with views of downtown and beyond. The Mediterranean-inspired small plates and craft cocktails make it a stylish spot for pre-dinner drinks or a full evening out.

## The Setting

The rooftop terrace is the draw—open-air seating with views of Naples' skyline, comfortable lounge seating, and a chic, modern aesthetic. It's one of the few rooftop dining options in the area.

## The Menu

Mediterranean small plates designed for sharing:
- **Flatbreads:** Various toppings, perfect for sharing
- **Charcuterie & Cheese:** Curated boards
- **Mezze:** Hummus, baba ganoush, olives
- **Fresh Salads:** Light and flavorful

## The Cocktails

The bar program is strong—creative craft cocktails, an excellent wine list, and bartenders who take their work seriously.

## Perfect For

- **Date night:** Romantic rooftop setting
- **Pre-dinner drinks:** Before dinner elsewhere
- **Nightlife:** One of Naples' later-night spots
- **Special occasions:** Celebratory atmosphere

## Tips

- **Limited hours:** Wed-Sun only
- **Weather-dependent:** Best on clear evenings
