## The Lively Sister

While Osteria Tulia next door is refined Italian dining, Bar Tulia brings a more casual, energetic vibe. Think elevated bar food, creative cocktails, and a buzzing atmosphere that's perfect for groups.

## The Vibe

Bar Tulia is Naples' answer to a trendy gastropub—exposed brick, craft cocktails, communal tables, and a DJ on weekends. It's where younger Naples comes to play.

## The Food

#### Small Plates & Sharing
- **Charcuterie Board:** House-cured meats, excellent cheeses
- **Truffle Fries:** Addictively good
- **Meatballs:** From the Osteria kitchen, perfection

#### Mains
- **Bar Tulia Burger:** One of Naples' best
- **Wood-Fired Pizza:** Available late night
- **Pasta:** Select options from Osteria's menu

## The Bar

Craft cocktails are the star:
- **Negroni:** Classic Italian perfect
- **Seasonal Specials:** Creative, balanced, fun
- **Italian Wines:** By the glass or bottle
- **Late Night:** Open later than most Naples spots

## When to Go

- **Happy Hour:** Great specials early evening
- **Late Night:** One of few places open past 10pm
- **Weekends:** DJ and dancing, very lively
- **Groups:** Communal tables work well
