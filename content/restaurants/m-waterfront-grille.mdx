## Modern Elegance on the Bay

M Waterfront Grille combines contemporary cuisine with one of Naples' most beautiful dining settings. The bay views are spectacular, and the kitchen delivers modern American fare with precision.

## The Menu

Contemporary American with global influences:
- **Seared Scallops:** Perfectly caramelized, creative accompaniments
- **Prime Filet:** Expertly prepared
- **Fresh Fish:** Chef's daily preparations
- **Seasonal Specials:** Menu evolves with the seasons

## The View

Floor-to-ceiling windows maximize bay views from the interior. The outdoor terrace is the prime spot, especially at sunset.

## Setting

Sleek, modern design with white accents and natural light. It feels sophisticated but not stuffy—elegant Naples at its best.

## Tips

- **Reservations recommended:** Especially for bay views
- **Dress:** Resort casual to smart casual
- **Lunch is great:** Less crowded, same views
