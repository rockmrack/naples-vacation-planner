## A Taste of France in Naples

Bleu Provence transports diners to the South of France without leaving Southwest Florida. For over 20 years, this elegant restaurant has maintained its reputation as Naples' premier French dining destination.

## The Cuisine

Classic French techniques meet Florida ingredients:

- **Bouillabaisse:** The Provençal fish stew is legendary here
- **Duck Confit:** Crispy skin, tender meat, perfection
- **Dover Sole Meunière:** Tableside presentation, butter-lemon magic
- **Rack of Lamb:** Herb-crusted, rosy pink, excellent

## The Wine Cellar

With 400+ French bottlings and a Wine Spectator Award of Excellence, the wine program is serious. The sommelier can navigate the extensive list for any budget.

## The Atmosphere

White linens, soft lighting, and French service create an atmosphere of refined elegance. This is the place for quiet conversation, not boisterous groups.

## Perfect For

- **Anniversaries:** The quintessential romantic dinner spot
- **French cuisine enthusiasts:** Authentic and expertly prepared
- **Wine dinners:** Regular themed events with paired courses
- **Special occasions:** Proposals, milestone birthdays

## Know Before You Go

- **Dress code:** Smart casual to dressy (jacket appreciated)
- **Price:** Expect $100-150 per person with wine
- **Reservations:** Essential, especially weekends
- **Parking:** Valet available on 5th Avenue
