## Dining at Water's Edge

Baleen at LaPlaya offers something truly special in Naples—fine dining directly on the sand with unobstructed Gulf of Mexico views. Located at the boutique LaPlaya Beach Resort, this restaurant combines coastal sophistication with barefoot-friendly relaxation.

## The Setting

The outdoor terrace sits just steps from the water, making it one of the most romantic dinner spots in Southwest Florida. As the sun sets, the sky puts on a show that no other entertainment can match.

## The Menu

Executive Chef creates a menu that celebrates Florida's Gulf Coast:

- **Gulf Grouper:** Fresh from local waters, prepared with seasonal preparations
- **Baleen Lobster Roll:** Decadent, butter-drenched Maine lobster
- **Crab-Stuffed Flounder:** A house specialty
- **Dry-Aged Steaks:** For non-seafood lovers

## Breakfast with a View

Don't overlook breakfast at Baleen—the morning sun over the Gulf, combined with excellent coffee and creative breakfast dishes, is a wonderful way to start your Naples day.

## Planning Your Visit

- **Sunset tables book quickly:** Reserve 3-4 weeks ahead in season
- **Valet parking:** $15, use the resort entrance
- **Resort casual dress:** No cover-ups or wet swimwear at dinner
- **Non-guests welcome:** You don't need to stay at LaPlaya to dine
- **Weather backup:** Indoor seating available with still-excellent views
