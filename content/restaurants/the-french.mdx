## A Taste of Paris on 3rd Street

The French brings authentic Parisian elegance to downtown Naples. From the bistro-style interior to the classic menu, it's a transportive dining experience.

## Sunday Jazz Brunch

The Sunday jazz brunch is legendary. Live jazz accompanies French-inspired brunch dishes in a setting that feels like a Left Bank cafe. It's one of Naples' most sought-after reservations.

## The Dinner Menu

Classic French, expertly prepared:
- **Coq au Vin:** Braised chicken in wine, traditional
- **Steak Frites:** Perfectly cooked with pommes frites
- **Duck Confit:** Fall-apart tender, crispy skin
- **Dover Sole:** Tableside filleted

## The Atmosphere

Intimate and elegant, The French seats fewer than 60 diners. White linens, bistro chairs, and soft lighting create romance.

## Tips

- **Jazz brunch:** Book 2-3 weeks ahead
- **Limited hours:** Dinner Wed-Sat only
- **Dress:** Smart casual to dressy
- **Intimate:** Better for couples than large groups
