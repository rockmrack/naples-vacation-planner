## Naples' First Osteria

Osteria Tulia brings the warmth and authenticity of an Italian osteria to downtown Naples. Chef/Owner Vincenzo Betulia has created a dining experience that feels like stepping into a rustic Italian farmhouse, complete with handmade pastas, house-cured meats, and an exceptional wine program.

## The Experience

From the moment you enter, the open kitchen draws your attention—watch as pasta is rolled, meat is carved, and dishes are plated with precision. The atmosphere strikes the perfect balance between refined and relaxed, making it ideal for everything from a casual dinner to a special celebration.

## What to Order

Start with the **house-made burrata**, drizzled with olive oil and served with crusty bread. For your main course, the **handmade pappardelle** with wild boar ragù is legendary, or opt for the perfectly cooked **wood-fired branzino** for a lighter option.

The **bone-in ribeye** (for two) is a showstopper, carved tableside and paired with seasonal vegetables.

## Wine Program

With over 400 Italian wines on the list, Osteria Tulia has earned Wine Spectator's Award of Excellence. The knowledgeable sommeliers can guide you to the perfect pairing, from crisp Northern Italian whites to bold Tuscan reds.

## Insider Tips

- **Reservations essential:** Book at least 2 weeks ahead during season (January-April)
- **Sit at the bar:** For a more casual experience with full menu access
- **Save room for dessert:** The tiramisu is made in-house daily
- **Outdoor patio:** Request it on pleasant evenings for prime 5th Avenue people-watching
