## 100 Wines by the Glass

Fleming's distinguishes itself with one of the best by-the-glass wine programs in Naples. With 100 wines available by the glass, you can explore without committing to a full bottle—perfect for pairing different wines with each course.

## The Beef

USDA Prime beef, hand-selected for quality:
- **Prime Filet Mignon:** Buttery tender, perfectly cooked
- **Bone-In Ribeye:** Richly marbled, full-flavored
- **Porterhouse:** Best of both worlds
- **All steaks:** Custom-aged, hand-cut

## Beyond Steak

- **Lobster Tail:** Cold water, butter-poached
- **Chilean Sea Bass:** For seafood preferences
- **Fleming's Potatoes:** Maybe the best side in town

## Location

The Mercato location puts you in the heart of North Naples' upscale shopping and dining district. Easy parking and pleasant walk-around area before or after dinner.

## Tips

- **Happy hour:** Fleming's Prime Burger and drink specials
- **Private dining:** Excellent for groups
