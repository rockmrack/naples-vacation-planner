## Sister Restaurant Excellence

From the team behind Osteria Tulia comes Barbatella, a more casual yet equally delicious take on Italian cuisine. The name means "young grapevine" in Italian, and the restaurant brings that same spirit of growth and vitality to its food.

## The Pastas

Handmade daily in-house, the pastas are the star:

- **Gnocchi al Tartufo:** Pillowy gnocchi with black truffle, the must-order dish
- **Pappardelle Bolognese:** Rich, meaty, comforting
- **Cacio e Pepe:** Simple perfection with pecorino and black pepper

## Small Plates to Share

Start with the **Polenta Board**—creamy polenta with seasonal toppings, perfect for sharing. The burrata and the meatballs are also crowd favorites.

## The Space

Barbatella feels like a modern Italian wine bar—exposed brick, communal tables, and a lively atmosphere. It's less formal than Osteria Tulia but maintains the same commitment to quality.

## Tips

- **No reservations for parties under 6:** First come, first served
- **Bar seating:** Great for solo diners or couples
- **Happy hour:** Check for specials
- **Takeout available:** Pastas travel well
