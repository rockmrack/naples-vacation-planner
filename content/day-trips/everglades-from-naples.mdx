## Two Main Options

### Option 1: Everglades City (Closest)

Everglades City is a small, quirky town at the edge of the Everglades. It's the gateway to:

- **Airboat tours** – The classic Everglades experience

- **Big Cypress National Preserve** – Hiking and wildlife

**What to do:**
1. Take an airboat tour (1–2 hours)
2. Stop at the Big Cypress Swamp Welcome Center
3. Grab lunch at the old-school **Havana Cafe** or **Joanie's Blue Crab Cafe**
4. Consider a kayak or boat tour of the Ten Thousand Islands

### Option 2: Shark Valley (Further, But Iconic)

**Drive time:** 1.5 hours via I-75 + US-41

Shark Valley is part of Everglades National Park (not Big Cypress). It offers:

- 15-mile paved loop trail (bike, tram, or walk)
- Observation tower with 360° views
- Guaranteed alligator sightings

**Best for:** Travelers who want a more immersive, less "touristy" experience.
