<EditorNote type="info">
  **Wildlife Guarantee:** If you visit during the dry season (Dec-April), seeing an alligator is almost 100% guaranteed. In the wet season (summer), they disperse, but the lush scenery is spectacular.

## It's Wild. It's Close. It's Mandatory.
The Everglades isn't just a swamp; it's a UNESCO World Heritage site and the largest subtropical wilderness in the US. And the best entry point—**Everglades City**—is less than an hour from 5th Avenue South.

## 3 Ways to Do The Everglades

### 1. The "Classic" (Airboat Tour)
This is what you came for. Skimming across the water at 30mph.
*   **The Trick:** Do **not** get on the large 50-passenger boats. They are loud and slow.
*   **Expert Pick:** Book a "Small Airboat" private tour with **Wooten’s** or **Captain Jack’s**. You get a headset to talk to the captain and access to smaller mangrove tunnels the big boats can't fit in.

### 2. The "Explorer" (Ten Thousand Islands)
Take a calmer boat tour from the Everglades National Park Gulf Coast Visitor Center.
*   **Why:** This goes out to the saltwater estuary. You will see **wild dolphins** playing in the wake and likely manatees.

### 3. The "Hiker" (Big Cypress Boardwalks)
Drive 15 mins past Everglades City to **Big Cypress National Preserve**.
*   **Kirby Storter Boardwalk:** A stunning 1-mile round trip walk into a cypress dome. It feels prehistoric.
*   **Gator Hook:** Free roadside stops where gators sun themselves just feet from the car (safely separated by water/fence).

## The Perfect Half-Day Itinerary

*   **9:00 AM:** Depart Naples. Drive east on Tamiami Trail (US-41).
*   **10:00 AM:** Airboat Tour in Everglades City.
*   **11:30 AM:** Visit the **Smallwood Store**. It’s an old trading post turned museum on the water. Incredible history.
*   **12:30 PM:** Lunch at **City Seafood** or **Camellia Street Grill**.
    *   *Order:* Fresh stone crab claws (in season) or a fried grouper sandwich.

## FAQ

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "Is it safe for kids?",
    answer: "Yes! Kids age 3+ usually love the airboats (they provide ear protection). It is loud, so very young sensitive children might prefer the slower pontoon boat tours."
  },
  {
    question: "Shark Valley vs. Everglades City?",
    answer: "Shark Valley (famous for the bike loop) is another hour east (90 mins from Naples). For a day trip, Everglades City is much closer and offers more variety (boats, food, history)."
