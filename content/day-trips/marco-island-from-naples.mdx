## Why Cross the Bridge?
Marco Island feels different than Naples. It’s wider, slower, and beachier. The condos are bigger, the sand is vast, and the vibe is distinctively "island time."

<ProsCons 
  pros={[
    "Shelling: Marco is famous for sand dollars and whelks.",
    "Dining: Waterfront dining here is more casual/fun than Naples.",
    "Wildlife: Burrowing owls are everywhere (look for the little PVC pipe markers in yards)."

    "Beach Walk: The walk from parking to the water at Tigertail is long (explore the lagoon first!)."

## The "Perfect Day" Itinerary

### Morning: Tigertail Beach (9:00 AM)
Go straight to **Tigertail Beach Park**.
*   **The Adventure:** You have to wade across a shallow lagoon to get to the "Sand Dollar Spit."
*   **Why Do It?** Because the spit is pristine, uncrowded, and full of shells.
*   **Pro Tip:** Bring water shoes for the lagoon crossing.

### Lunch: The Snook Inn (12:30 PM)
You can't go to Marco without eating here.
*   **The Scene:** Thatch roof, extensive salad bar (famous for pickles), and live music.
*   **The View:** It sits right on the Marco River. Dolphins often swim by the dock while you eat.

### Afternoon: The "Dome Homes" or South Beach
*   **Option A (Boat):** Take a tour to see the famous **Cape Romano Dome Homes**—strange concrete domes rising out of the sea (hurricanes have claimed them, see them while they last!).
*   **Option B (Relax):** Drive to **South Marco Beach** for a traditional beach afternoon.

### Evening: Ice Cream & Sunset
Before heading back bridge:
*   **Treat:** **Sweet Annie's Ice Cream Parlour**. Old-school candy shop vibe.
*   **Sunset:** Watch it from **Kane's Tiki Bar** at the JW Marriott (open to public for drinks).

## FAQ

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "Is Tigertail Beach hard to access?",
    answer: "The 'adventure' route across the lagoon requires wading in knee-deep water. If you don't want to get wet, it's a very long walk around. We say embrace the lagoon!"
  },
  {
    question: "Is parking easy?",
    answer: "At Tigertail, yes (huge lot, $10). At South Beach, public parking is limited and fills up fast. Go early or late."
  }
