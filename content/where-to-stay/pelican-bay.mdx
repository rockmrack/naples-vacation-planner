## A Sanctuary in the City
**Pelican Bay** feels different. It’s not just manicured lawns; it’s a massive nature preserve with luxury towers rising out of it. It separates the "built world" from the beach with a stunning mangrove forest.

To get to the sand, you ride a **private open-air tram** (or walk the boardwalk) winding through the trees. It feels like Jurassic Park meeting the French Riviera.
