  **Local Secret:** Park Shore has a private beach park for residents, but visitors can access the same stunning stretch of sand via **Clam Pass Park** or the public access points.

## Where Beach Meets Bay
**Park Shore** was master-planned to be beautiful. It sits on a barrier island with the Gulf of Mexico on one side and Venetian Bay on the other. This means water views everywhere you look.

<ProsCons 
  pros={[
    "Venetian Village: The most charming waterfront shopping center in Florida is your 'downtown'.",
    "Central: You are halfway between Old Naples (South) and Mercato (North).",

  ]}
  cons={[
    "Beach Access: Most hotels are a short walk or tram ride to the sand (not direct step-out).",

## Where to Stay in Park Shore

### 1. Edgewater Beach Hotel ($$$$)
*Best For: A classic beachfront suite experience.*

This is a rare find—an all-suite hotel right on the beach in a neighborhood of private condos.
*   **The Room:** Every room is a suite with a kitchen. Ask for a **Gulf Front Suite** on a high floor for sunset views.
*   **Vibe:** Casual elegance. It feels residential, not mega-resort.

### 2. The Inn at Pelican Bay ($$$)
*Best For: Boutique luxury value.*

Located just north of Park Shore proper, but serving the same area.
*   **Amenities:** Incredible lake views, upscale breakfast (included), and a private shuttle to Vanderbilt Beach.
*   **Value:** You get luxury service for 30% less than the dazzling beachfront resorts.

### 3. Hilton Naples ($$)
*Best For: Budget-conscious luxury.*

Don't let the name fool you. This is a 4-diamond hotel famous for:
*   **Shula's Steakhouse:** Located in the lobby.
*   **Beach Shuttle:** Free shuttle to Clam Pass Beach.
*   **Location:** Walkable to Waterside Shops.

## FAQ
