## Jennifer’s Top Picks: Where to Stay

### 1. The Ritz-Carlton, Naples ($$$$$)
*Best For: The gold standard of luxury.*

This isn't just a hotel; it's a destination.
*   **The Room to Book:** The new **Club Level Ocean View**. The club lounge offers five food presentations a day (breakfast, lunch, snacks, hors d'oeuvres, chocolates). You barely need to leave the resort.
*   **Don't Miss:** The sunset "Gumbo Limbo" beach bar. It’s unmatched.

### 2. LaPlaya Beach & Golf Resort ($$$$)
*Best For: A relaxed, boutique feel.*

While the Ritz is grand, **LaPlaya** feels intimate.
*   **Vibe:** Old Florida elegance. Think dark wood, white linens, and fire pits on the sand.
*   **Pro Tip:** Dinner at **BALEENnaples** (on-site) involves tables right on the sand. It’s one of the most romantic spots in town.

### 3. Naples Grande Beach Resort ($$$)
*Best For: Families and active travelers.*

Located just south of Vanderbilt (technically accessible via Clam Pass), this resort is huge.
*   **Kids Love:** The 100-foot waterslide in the pool complex.
*   **Beach Access:** A fun open-air tram takes you through the mangroves to the beach.

## Dining & Activities
You are here for the beach, but you aren't stranded.

### Walkable Dining
*   **The Turtle Club:** Right on the sand. Famous for a reason. Book months in advance.

### Nearby (5 Min Drive)
*   **Mercato:** The nightlife hub of North Naples.
    *   **The Hampton Social** ("Rosé all day" vibe)
    *   **Rocco's Tacos** (Lively, tequila bar)
    *   **Capital Grille** (Upscale steakhouse)

## FAQ

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "Do I need a car?",
    answer: "Yes. While you can walk the beach for miles, getting to grocery stores or varied dining at Mercato requires a quick 5-minute drive/Uber."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the beach crowded?",
    answer: "The public access point gets busy, but the hotels (Ritz, LaPlaya) have their own roped-off sections with chairs and umbrellas, which feels very private."
  }
